  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>MacPorts is a system for building, installing, and managing free and
  open source software. It is developed on Mac OS X, though it is designed to
  be portable so it can work on other Unix-like systems, especially those
  descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). A MacPorts "port"
  is an application that has been defined within the ports hierarchy by
  describing its characteristics and anything required to install it within a
  file named <filename>Portfile</filename>, so MacPorts may be used to
  automatically fetch, patch, compile, and install the application. MacPorts
  provides two major advantages over installing free and open source software
  manually.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>It confines ported applications to a private "sandbox" that keeps
      ported software from intermingling with your operating system and its
      vendor-supplied libraries, thus preventing them from becoming
      corrupted.</para>
