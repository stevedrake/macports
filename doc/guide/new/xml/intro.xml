  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>MacPorts is a system for building, installing, and managing free and
  open source software. It is developed on Mac OS X, though it is designed to
  be portable so it can work on other Unix-like systems, especially *BSD. A
  MacPorts "port" consists of a <filename>Portfile</filename> that defines the
  characteristics of the application to which it corresponds, so that MacPorts
  may be used to fetch, compile, and install it. MacPorts provides several
  significant advantages over installing free and open source software
  manually.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>It confines ported applications to a private "sandbox" that keeps
      ported software from intermingling with your operating system and its
      vendor-supplied libraries to prevent them from becoming
      corrupted.</para>
