  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>MacPorts is a system for building, installing, and managing free and
  open source software. MacPorts "ports" are definitions of applications,
  their characteristics, and any files or special instructions required to
  install them in files named <filename>Portfile</filename>s, so MacPorts may
  automatically fetch, patch, compile, and install ported applications.</para>

  <para>MacPorts may also be used to pre-compile ported applications into
  binaries that may be installed on remote computers. Binaries of ported
  applications may be installed very quickly since the steps required to
  install ports from source code have all been performed in advance. MacPorts
  provides several major advantages over installing free and open source
  software manually.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>MacPorts automatically installs a given port's required support
      applications or libraries, known as "dependencies".</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>MacPorts confines ported software to a private "sandbox" that
      keeps it from intermingling with your operating system and its
      vendor-supplied libraries and prevents them from becoming
      corrupted.</para>

    <listitem>
      <para>MacPorts provides automatic uninstalls and upgrades of ported
      software.</para>

  <para>MacPorts is developed on Mac OS X, though it is designed to be
  portable so it can work on other Unix-like systems, especially those
  descended from the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).</para>

    <title>Document Conventions</title>

    <para>The MacPorts Guide uses some notational conventions to distinguish
    between terminal input/output, file text, and other data types.</para>
