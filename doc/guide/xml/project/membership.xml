		<title>Becoming a DarwinPorts committer</title>

		<para>Becoming a member of the DarwinPorts project with commit access
		to our CVS repository is pretty much a matter of involvement in any of
		the project areas and the record you can establish thereof. We encourage
		any developer and/or volunteer to apply for a CVS account if certain simple
		requirements are met:</para>

			<varlistentry id='list'>
				<term>
					Involvement on the List:
				</term>
				<listitem>
					<para>One key attribute of any DarwinPorts committer must be
					enthusiasm for the project, so therefore we appreciate applicants
					who've shown their involvement through active participation
					on the <ulink url="http://opendarwin.org/mailman/listinfo/darwinports">main user list</ulink>,
					either through general user support and/or project roadmap discussion
					and brainstorming.</para>

					Contribution record:

				<listitem>
					<para>If applying for access to the "dports" section of the project,
					an established record as a maintainer of already existing ports is
					preferable. This can be accomplished either through the inheritance
					of abandoned ports (those with the sole darwinports [at] opendarwin DOT org
					maintainer address) or through writing your own from scratch. If instead
					you plan to apply to any other area, like "base" or "www", contributions
					in the form of patches that can vouch for your skills on the aspects you
					plan to help with are certainly a big plus. In all cases, submissions to
					the project should be processed per the instructions detailed on the
					<ulink url="/docs/ch15.html">"DarwinPorts Submissions"</ulink> chapter.</para>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>

		<para>If you feel you meet and comply with these requirements and wish to
		become a member of the group to help out personally, do feel free to send
		a note to the portmgr [at] opendarwin DOT org steering committee explaining
		your contributions, how long you've been involved and why you'd make a good
		committer. The sole purpose of said forum is overseeing the general evolution
		of the project, so they are the ones to turn to for membership requests.</para>

		<para>For a brief listing of the duties &amp; benefits resulting from holding
		an OpenDarwin account, along with a short jump start on CVS primaries, read
		OpenDarwin's <ulink url="http://opendarwin.org/en/articles/committer_guide/ar01s02.html">Committer's Guide</ulink>
		for account applicants. The <ulink url="http://wiki.opendarwin.org/index.php/Darwinports:New_committers_guide">New Committer's Guide</ulink>
		is also a must read for new comers to become acquainted with our procedures and
		guidelines.</para>
