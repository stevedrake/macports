		<title>About this chapter</title>
		 
		<para>This document provides a short guide to the basics of the 
		DarwinPorts system. The first section provides a short description 
		of the goals of the project and a brief comparison with other systems. 
		Subsequent sections describe how to get, install, and use DarwinPorts 
		on your own machines. </para>

	<sect1 id='about_dports'>
		<title>About DarwinPorts</title> 
		
		<para>The aim of the DarwinPorts project is to develop a second-
		generation system for the building, installation and management of 
		third party software. DarwinPorts is mainly developed on Mac OS X, 
		however by design it is quite portable and is intended to work on 
		other UNIX-like systems, especially *BSD and hopefully Linux-based 
		systems.  </para>

		
		<para>DarwinPorts is probably best described by comparison:  It's sort 
		of like the <ulink url='http://www.freebsd.org/ports'>FreeBSD ports 
		collection</ulink> or <ulink url='http://fink.sf.org/'>Fink</ulink> 
		in that it automates the process of building third party software for 
		Mac OS X and other operating systems.  DarwinPorts also tracks all 
		dependency information for a given piece of software. In other words, 
		it knows what it needs to build and install and in what order for the 
		piece of software you want to work properly. DarwinPorts knows how to 
		make, build and install the software to a specific location, meaning 
		that software installed via DarwinPorts doesn't simply scatter itself 
		all over the system or require user knowledge of dependencies in what 
		order. </para>

		
		<para>The FreeBSD Ports Collection is a large set of software packages 
		ported to FreeBSD. The ports collection is also used on the other "free"
		BSDs. The FreeBSD Ports Collection is based on a large tree of ports 
		where each software has a directory within a category (like mail or 
		graphics). That directory contains the information needed to build the 
		piece of software. DarwinPorts also uses a directory structure like this,
		although unlike FreeBSD ports the intention is to avoid requiring a 
		complete copy of the 'Ports Tree' on every user's machine.  The FreeBSD 
		Ports Collection is essentially implemented as some very impressive but
		hairy BSD make(1)'s macros and can be  opaque and non-extensible from 
		the perspective of someone looking to extend or refactor parts of the 
		system.  Given that makefiles aren't the easiest thing to parse or for
		non-developers to understand, it is also harder to "mine" the FreeBSD
		ports collection for data to use for other purposes such as 
		generating documentation indexes or arbitrary front-ends for 
		creating or managing ports. </para>


		<para>A ports collection can be considered an 'expert system' that 
		knows the sources, dependencies, and other information necessary to 
		*build* a given Open Source project.  A package management system relies 
		on similar dependency information, but is focused on safely installing 
		(and de-installing) software.   Before DarwinPorts, most systems did 
		both at once; DarwinPorts, however, is explicitly designed as a pure 
		ports collection which can use various package management systems.
		</para>

		
		<para>Even discounting some of the limitations of The FreeBSD Ports 
		Collection described above, creating automated build systems is rather 
		more complex than it looks at first glance and there's always room for 
		fresh approaches to the problem.  Which is what we have set out to do 
		with DarwinPorts. There are certainly other systems, some of which have 
		already been mentioned, which have made their own attempts at solving 
		this problem. There will likely be many more such systems in the future 
		since trying to find a single solution which pleases everyone is rather 
		like trying to find a single programming language which pleases everyone 
		- it's more or less impossible. </para>

		
		<para>DarwinPorts is mostly written in Tcl, with some components written 
		in C. Tcl was chosen to allow DarwinPorts to be readily embedded in other 
		applications (e.g. a Cocoa GUI) and to allow flexible, but easy to read 
		Portfiles. </para>

		
		<para>Even though DarwinPorts is written in Tcl, users do not need to know 
		Tcl in order to use the system or even to add new ports.  Port description 
		files, though they are actually full Tcl programs in their own right, are 
		designed to look like a simple list of key/value pairs. </para>

		<title>Installing DarwinPorts</title>
		
		<sect2 id='prerequisites'>
			<title>What you need</title>
			
			<para>DarwinPorts primary target platform is Mac OS X 10.4
			"Tiger" and Mac OS X 10.3 "Panther" (i. e. Darwin 8.x and 7.x).
			However,
			DarwinPorts should still work on Mac OS X 10.2 "Jaguar", although
			most ports are no longer tested on Jaguar. DarwinPorts is also
			known to work on various other operating systems such as FreeBSD,
			NetBSD, OpenBSD, and various Linux distributions.  These
			instructions should enable DarwinPorts to be installed on any of
			these platforms.</para>

			<para>To install and use DarwinPorts you must install the Developer 
			tools (gcc, autoconf etc on other platforms, also known as the
			"Xcode tools" on Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.4.).
			All the other prerequisites are
			pre-installed on Mac OS X 10.2 and later. On other platforms you
			will need to ensure you have installed Tcl (8.3 or later). </para>

		</sect2>
		
		<sect2 id='getting_dports'>
			<title>Obtaining DarwinPorts</title>	
			
			<para>Currently there are basically two ways to obtain DarwinPorts.
			Either download the sources as a tarball or get the binary
			installer via the downloadable disk image (both available in the
			<ulink url='http://www.darwinports.org/downloads/'>download
			section</ulink>). If you choose the binary installer, you can skip
			the next sections.</para>

			<para>If you want greater control and want to e. g. specify one of
			the various install-time options, you need to get the sources.
			</para>
						  	
			<para>If you want to very closely track the latest ports and use
			the latest experimental features of the port tool, you may want to
			use cvs to check out the sources from our cvs repository.</para>
		</sect2>
		
		<sect2 id='install_dports'>
			<title>Installing DarwinPorts from sources</title>
			
			<para>To install DarwinPorts execute the following commands from the 
			darwinports/base directory.  These commands assume that you checked
			out the darwinports tree from CVS or downloaded and extracted the
			tarball in your home directory.  Modify
			the <userinput>cd</userinput> command appropriately if you did
			otherwise.
			<programlisting><![CDATA[% cd ~/darwinports/base
% ./configure 
% make
% sudo make install]]></programlisting>
			This will compile and install all the necessary software. In order 
			to install DarwinPorts on *BSD the default group-ownership must be 
			passed to each make command: <userinput>make DSTGRP=wheel
			</userinput>.</para>
		</sect2>

		<sect2 id='configure_dports'>
			<title>Configuring for DarwinPorts</title>
			
			<para>It is no longer necessary to edit
			<filename>${prefix}/etc/ports/sources.conf</filename> after installing
			DarwinPorts.  If you change the location of the
			<filename>dports</filename> directory, which was in
			<filename>~/darwinports/dports</filename> based on the above
			examples, then you will still need to edit
			<filename>${prefix}/etc/ports/sources.conf</filename> and modify the
			<userinput>file:///Users/mike/darwinports/dports</userinput> line
			to reflect the new location.  To edit the file you must use a
			command line text editor like pico or vi. </para>

			<note><para>Please note, if you are using Mac OS X 10.2 "Jaguar", then
				you will need to edit <filename>${prefix}/etc/ports/ports.conf</filename> and
				change: <computeroutput>portinstalltype image</computeroutput>
				to: <userinput>portinstalltype direct</userinput></para></note>
			
			<para>You should add /opt/local/bin (or wherever you chose to 
			install DarwinPorts) to your shell's path.</para>

			<para>If you are using Mac OS X 10.3 "Panther", Mac OS X 10.4 "Tiger"
			 or a Bourne shell (bash, zsh), add the following line to your
			<filename>~/.profile</filename>:</para>

			<para><userinput>export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/bin</userinput></para>

			<para>If you are using Mac OS X 10.2 "Jaguar" or a C shell (tcsh),
			add the following line to your
			<filename>~/.cshrc</filename>:</para>

			<para><userinput>set path=($path /opt/local/bin)</userinput></para>
	
			<para>These changes will not take effect until you have opened a
			new shell. If you upgraded your Mac OS X installation from 10.2,
			you might still have a C shell as login shell.</para>

			<para>Once you have got this far, you should have a working 
			installation of DarwinPorts, you have installed the 'port' 
			command (by default this installed as
			<filename>/opt/local/bin/port</filename>) 
			and the libraries it needs (in
			<filename>/opt/local/share/darwinports</filename> 
			and <filename>/Library/Tcl/darwinports1.0</filename> by
			default.) 
			</para>

			
		</sect2>

		<sect2  id='updating_dports'>
			<title>Updating DarwinPorts</title>
			
			<para>New ports are always being added to the DarwinPorts dports 
			tree, you should regularly update your tree to get access to new 
			ports, and (hopefully) improved versions of current ports. 
			Currently the simplest way you can update the dports tree is to use
			the selfupdate feature of port.
			To start a (rsync based) selfupdate, just issue
			<command>port sync</command>.
			</para>

			<para>Updating your port tool is equally easy to accomplish. If
			you are using at least version 1.0 of port,
			<command>port selfupdate</command>
			will update the sources of port, recompile and install them for you
			with the same options you installed your current version of port.

			<title>The port command</title>

			<!--

			<para>Using DarwinPorts is very straightforward, most of the time 
			all you need to do is execute a single command to install a port. 
			For example, if you want to install the text editor vile, you'd 
			simply execute the command <userinput>sudo port install vile
			</userinput>. That will fetch, build and install vim and anything 
			else vim needs to work. All of the examples below use the vile 
			port as an example, you should use whatever port you actually 
			want to install.</para>
			
			<para>If you aren't sure of the exact name of your port you can 
			use the search feature. For example, if you wanted to find out 
			if there was anything called vile in the ports you could do: 
			<userinput>port search 'vile'</userinput>. The search facility 
			uses standard regular expression syntax, so you can list all 
			the ports by doing: <userinput>port search '.+'</userinput>.</para>
			
			<para>You can see more detail of what is happening when you 
			install a port by using the verbose (-v), or debug (-d) flags 
			when using the port install command, to see all the possible 
			output use them both together: <userinput>port -v -d install 
			vile</userinput>. </para>

			<para>You may break up the installation of a port into a number of 
			steps, fetch, checksum, configure, build, and finally install. Each 
			of these steps performs a part of the process to install a port, 
			using the steps individually is however not normally needed unless 
			you are developing a new port or are trying to diagnose a 
			problem. </para>

			<para>Once the port has been installed, you may want to delete 
			all the intermediate files that DarwinPorts has created while 
			building the port, to do this you should enter: 
			<userinput>port clean vile</userinput>.</para>
			-->

			<para>Using the DarwinPorts <userinput>port</userinput> command is
			very straight-forward.  Most of the time all you need to do is
			execute a single command to install a port.  For example, if you
			want to install the text editor vile, you would simply
			type:</para>

			<para><userinput>sudo port install vile</userinput></para>

			<para>That will fetch, build and install vile and anything else it
			needs to work.  All of the examples below use the vile for as an
			example.  You should use whatever port you actually want
			to install.</para>

			<title>The portindex command</title>
			
			<para>Most of the time you won't need to use this command as

			sometimes the index you have is out of date or innacurate for 
			some reason. When this occurs you will get an error message 
			like 'port search failed: expected integer but got "PortIndex"'.
			You can fix problem by moving to the dports directory 
			(/Users/mike/darwinports/dports in our examples) and 
			executing: <userinput>portindex</userinput>. This will go 
			through all the available ports in the dport directory and 
			build an index file called PortIndex.</para>

			<userinput>sudo port -n upgrade gnome</userinput>
			<para>To upgrade all installed ports simply do:</para>
			<userinput>sudo port -a upgrade</userinput>
			<para>If you dont like that upgrade just deactivates the old version
