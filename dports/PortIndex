I'd like to announce a fun DGPS hack. I've written a small Un*x server and client for redistributing DGPS correction signals over the Net. Basically the server grabs the serial byte stream from my DGPS radio and sends it off over a TCP connection. The client does the same thing but in reverse. The result is that you can receive the local DGPS corrections from absolutely anywhere by using the Internet as the world's largest extension cord. You'll still need to be within 1000 miles or so of San Francisco, California, USA for best results. However chances are better error will still be reduced if you are 2000 to 3000 miles away. Several respondents from 2000 miles away have noted that the remote differential signals have diminished the SA-induced position and velocity errors by approximately 3 times.}

Kings are high, so no cards may be placed to their right (they create dead spaces). When no moves can be made, cards still out of sequence are reshuffled and dealt face up after the ends of the partial sequences, leaving a card space after each sequence, so that each row looks like a partial sequence followed by a space, followed by enough cards to make a row of 14.

GNU Prolog accepts Prolog+constraint programs and produces native binaries (like gcc does from a C source). The obtained executable is then stand-alone. The size of this executable can be quite small since GNU Prolog can avoid linking the code of most unused built-in predicates. The performance of GNU Prolog is very encouraging (comparable to commercial systems). Beside native-code compilation, GNU Prolog offers a classical interactive interpreter (top-level) with a debugger.}

While the paper version remains the official standard, we think that in practice you'll find the Common Lisp HyperSpec much easier to navigate and use than its paper alternative.

The DHCP server, client and relay agent are provided both as reference implementations of the protocol and as working, fully-features sample implementations. Both the client and the server provide functionality that, while not strictly required by the protocol, is very useful in practice.

Also, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like rsync.

It was designed to replace the standard unix crypt utility, which is notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based on the Rijndael cipher, which is the U.S. government's chosen candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES, see http://www.nist.gov/aes/). This cipher is believed to provide very strong security. Unlike unix crypt, the algorithm provided by ccrypt is not symmetric, i.e., one must specify whether to encrypt or decrypt. The most common way to invoke ccrypt is via the commands ccencrypt and ccdecrypt. There is also a ccat command for decrypting a file directly to the terminal, thus reducing the likelihood of leaving temporary plaintext files around. In addition, there is a compatibility mode for decrypting legacy unix crypt files.}

Spinner is useful for keeping telnet and ssh links from dropping due to inactivity. Many firewalls, and some ISPs drop connections when they are perceived as idle. By having spinner running the server is constantly sending a tiny amount of data over the link, preserving the connection.
