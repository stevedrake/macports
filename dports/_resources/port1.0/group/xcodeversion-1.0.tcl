# This PortGroup lets a port check that the user's Xcode is sufficiently new.
# 
# Usage:
# 
#   PortGroup               xcodeversion 1.0
#   minimum_xcodeversions   {darwin_major minimum_xcodeversion}
# 
# where darwin_major is the major version of the underlying Darwin OS (e.g. 9
# for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard) and minimum_xcodeversion is the minimum version
# of Xcode the port requires (e.g. 3.1).
