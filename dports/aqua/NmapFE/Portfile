description	Cocoa frontend for the popular nmap port-scanning software.
long_description	NmapFE is a Cocoa frontend for the popular Nmap port-scanning software \
			written in Objective-C. It can also be useful as a "teaching tool" since \
			it shows the user how to construct a complex Nmap command line based on \
			their choices, and provides  background information (via tooltips) on what \
			the different choices mean.

# This port has two Xcode targets, "NmapFE" and "Nmap Launcher", which are both built by Xcode GroupCode
# through omission of any 'xcode.target' or 'build.target' clauses, which makes it default to -allTargets.
# Only the "Nmap Launcher" target is destrooted, however, given the dport's specific requirements.
