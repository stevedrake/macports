description		Program for creating application wrappers around scripts.
long_description	Platypus is a program for creating application \
					wrappers around scripts, i.e. creating MacOS X \
					applications that execute a script they are bundled \
					with. Scripts can thus be run transparently from the \
					graphical window environment without having to \
					resort to using the command line interface. It \
					supports drag and drop on created apps, running as \
					root using Authentication Manager and more.
