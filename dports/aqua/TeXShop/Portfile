description   	TeX previewer for Mac OS X
long_description   \
	TeXShop is a TeX previewer for Mac OS X, written in Cocoa. 	\
	Since pdf is a native file format on OS X, TeXShop uses 	\
	"pdftex" and "pdflatex" rather than "tex" and "latex" to 	\
	typeset, these programs in the standard teTeX distribution 	\
	of TeX produce pdf output instead of dvi output.
