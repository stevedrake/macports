long_description \
    A multiple protocol instant messaging client. This is a culmination of \
    a year long rewrite of Adium, which now utilizes libgaim (the core     \
    part of gaim) to connect to multiple protocols, and is also based on a \
    new plugin architecture. Partial address book integration, cool        \
    looking tabs, multiple protocols for instant messaging, and a compact  \
    contact list are some of the many features of the new Adium.
