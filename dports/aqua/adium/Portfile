description      a multiple protocol instant messaging client
long_description \
	A multiple protocol instant messaging client. This is a \
	culmination of a year long rewrite of Adium, which now \
	utilizes libgaim (the core part of gaim) to connect to \
	multiple protocols, and is also based on a new plugin \
	architecture. Partial address book integration, cool \
	looking tabs, multiple protocols for instant messaging, \
	and a compact contact list are some of the many \
	features of the new Adium.
