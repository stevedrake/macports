description      useless floating binary LED clock for your desktop
long_description \
	I was given a ThinkGeek binary clock by a friend (in a \
	not-so-transparent attempt to force me to learn binary \
	math). It sucks. It runs fast, very fast, gaining about \
	5 minutes per day, making it totally useless. So this is \
	my revenge on the world. Plus, I was drunk when I wrote it.
