description		Cyberduck is an open source SFTP and FTP browser
long_description	Cyberduck is an open source SFTP (SSH Secure File \
			Transfer) and FTP browser licenced under the GPL. It \
			has been built from the ground up with usability in \
			mind, having the same consistent graphical user \
			interface for both SFTP and FTP browsing. Multiple \
			connections are supported. Drag and drop is \
			supported consequently for transferring files \
			between server and client. A transfer queue keeps \
			track of the pending file transfers. A simple \
			bookmark manager ensures manageability. Core system \
			technologies such as the Keychain and Rendezvous are \
			supported. Cyberduck has been translated into \
			numerous languages including Japanese, Chinese, \
			Korean, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish \
			and Dutch.
