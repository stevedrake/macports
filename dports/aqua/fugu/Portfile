description		A Mac OS X SFTP, SCP and SSH Frontend.
long_description	Fugu is a graphical frontend to the commandline \
					Secure File Transfer application (SFTP). SFTP is \
					similar to FTP, but unlike FTP, the entire session \
					is encrypted, meaning no passwords are sent in \
					cleartext form, and is thus much less vulnerable to \
					third-party interception.
