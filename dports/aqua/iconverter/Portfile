long_description \
    Written originally as a developer tool to create ICNS \
    files from anything dropped on it, now it has evolved \
    to support icns, gif, jpg, png, bmp and tiff \
    exporting--and batch conversion. Can choose background \
    color for file types that do not preserve transparency.
