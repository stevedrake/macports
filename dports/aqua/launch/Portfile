description      command-line launcher for Mac OS X in the spirit of open
long_description \
	Apple provides a simple command-line launching program called open \
	with Mac OS X. It offers few options - launching applications by name \
	or by path, launching TextEdit, or opening a number of applications, \
	documents, folders, or URLs. With the exception of special support for \
	TextEdit (open -a), launch does all this and more.
