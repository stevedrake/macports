description      application that displays logfiles on your desktop
long_description \
	This is a little application that displays logfiles on your \
	desktop. Really useful if you have to monitor servers or you \
	just want to keep an eye on what's going on on your machine. \
	In its standard configuration it displays entries from any \
	number of logfiles interleaved in a single window. Have a \
	look at some screenshots. MkConsole is smart enough to close \
	and reopen files every now and then to deal with rotating \
	files and it transparently works around stale NFS handles \
	which often exist after your Mac wakes up from sleep and \
	tries to read from a logfile mounted via NFS. If you don't \
	mind hacking the user defaults (rather than using the \
	preferences panel) you can also configure multiple windows \
	with multiple logifiles each.
