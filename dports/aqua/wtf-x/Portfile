description 	A MacOSX programm to translate common Internet acronyms
long_description 	WTF-X is a Mac OS X programm to translate common Internet \
					acronyms. It's a port of BSD's commandline tool wtf, but \
					unlike this tool it's running as a service in OS X and \
					also offers a GUI to browse through all the acronyms and \
					add new ones.
