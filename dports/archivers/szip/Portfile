description	Szip is an implementation of the extended-Rice lossless compression \
		algorithm.
long_description \
	 	The Consultative Committee on Space Data Systems (CCSDS) has adopted \
	 	the extended-Rice algorithm for international standards for space \
	 	applications. Szip is reported to provide fast and effective \
	 	compression, specifically for the EOS data generated by the NASA \
	 	Earth Observatory System (EOS).	It was originally developed at \
	 	University of New Mexico (UNM) and integrated with HDF4 by UNM \
	 	researchers and developers.
