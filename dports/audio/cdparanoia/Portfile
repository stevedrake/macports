description		An audio extraction tool for sampling CDs.
long_description	\
	Cdparanoia is a Compact Disc Digital Audio (CDDA) extraction tool, \
	commonly known on the net as a 'ripper'. The application is built \
	on top of the Paranoia library, which is doing the real work (the \
	Paranoia source is included in the cdparanoia source distribution). \
	Like the original cdda2wav, cdparanoia package reads audio from the \
	CDROM directly as data, with no analog step between, and writes the \
	data to a file or pipe in WAV, AIFC or raw 16 bit linear PCM. \
	Cdparanoia is a bit different than most other CDDA extraction \
	tools. It contains few-to-no 'extra' features, concentrating only \
	on the ripping process and knowing as much as possible about the \
	hardware performing it. Cdparanoia will read correct, rock-solid \
	audio data from inexpensive drives prone to misalignment, frame \
	jitter and loss of streaming during atomic reads. Cdparanoia will \
	also read and repair data from CDs that have been damaged in some \
	way. At the same time, however, cdparanoia turns out to be easy to \
	use and administrate. It has no compile time configuration, happily \
	autodetecting the CDROM, its type, its interface and other aspects \
	of the ripping process at runtime. A single binary can serve the \
	diverse hardware of the do-it-yourself computer laboratory from Hell...
