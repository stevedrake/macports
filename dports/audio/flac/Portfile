long_description	FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec.  \
	Grossly oversimplified,FLAC is similar to MP3, but lossless, \
	meaning that audio iscompressed in FLAC without throwing away \
	any information. This issimilar to how Zip works, except with \
	FLAC you will get much better compression because it is \
	designed specifically for audio, and you canplay back \
	compressed FLAC files in your favorite player (or your car or \
	home stereo) just like you would an MP3 file.
