long_description \
	Herrie is a minimalistic music player that uses the command \
	line. It is written to support a variety of operating systems, \
	audio subsystems and file formats, including playlists. \
	\
	Herrie has a split-screen user interface, with a playlist at \
	the top of the screen and a file browser at the bottom. When \
	tracks are added to the playlist, Herrie automatically \
	consumes them one by one. It is thus an application that \
	allows you to batch music for playback. \
	\
	Herrie also has some more exotic features, including support \
	for AudioScrobbler and the ability to chroot() itself into a \
	directory.
