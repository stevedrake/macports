description      Lame Ain't an MP3 Encoder
long_description \
    LAME is an educational tool to be used for learning about MP3 \
    encoding. The goal of the LAME project is to use the open source \
    model to improve the psycho acoustics, noise shaping and speed of \
    MP3. LAME is not for everyone - it is distributed as source code \
    only and requires the ability to use a C compiler.
