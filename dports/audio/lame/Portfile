description       Lame Ain't an MP3 Encoder
long_description  LAME is an educational tool to be used for learning \
  about MP3 encoding. The goal of the LAME project is to use the open \
  source model to improve the psycho acoustics, noise shaping and speed \
  of MP3. LAME is not for everyone - it is distributed as source code \
  only and requires the ability to use a C compiler.
