description      a command line tool for MPD
long_description \
	mpc is a simple command line client for MPD.\
	Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, Ogg\
	Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists. MPD is\
	designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides\
	control for music playback over a local network. It also makes a great\
	desktop music player, especially if you are a console junkie, like\
	frontend options, or restart X often.
