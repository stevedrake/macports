description      Music Player Daemon
long_description \
	Music Player Daemon (MPD) allows remote access for playing music (MP3, Ogg\
	Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Mod, and wave files) and managing playlists. MPD is\
	designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that provides\
	control for music playback over a local network. It also makes a great\
	desktop music player, especially if you are a console junkie, like\
	frontend options, or restart X often.
