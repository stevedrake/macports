description      Fast compression for waveform files
long_description \
	Shorten reduces the size of waveform files (such as audio) using \
	Huffman coding of prediction residuals and optional additional \
	quantisation.  In lossless mode the amount of compression obtained \
	depends on the nature of the waveform.  Those composing of low \
	frequencies and low amplitudes give the best compression, which may \
	be 2:1 or better.  Lossy compression operates by specifying a \
	minimum acceptable segmental signal to noise ratio or a maximum bit \
	rate. Lossy compression operates by zeroing the lower order bits of \
	the waveform, so retaining waveform shape.
