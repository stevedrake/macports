long_description \
    Speex is an Open Source/Free Software patent-free audio \
    compression format designed for speech. The Speex Project \
    aims to lower the barrier of entry for voice applications \
    by providing a free alternative to expensive proprietary \
    speech codecs.  Moreover, Speex is well-adapted to \
    Internet applications and provides useful features that \
    are not present in most other codecs.
