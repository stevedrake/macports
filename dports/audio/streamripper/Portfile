version		1.61.5
categories	audio net
platforms	darwin
maintainers	mww@opendarwin.org
description	separate tracks via Shoutcasts title-streaming
long_description	Streamripper started as a way to separate tracks via \
			Shoutcasts title-streaming feature. This has now been \
			expanded into a much more generic feature, where part \
			of the program only tries to hint at where one track \
			starts and another ends, thus allowing a mp3 decoding \
			engine to scan for a silent mark, which is used to \
			find an exact track separation.
