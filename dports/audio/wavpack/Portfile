description     Hybrid lossless audio compression
long_description        WavPack is a completely open audio compression format \
                        providing lossless, high-quality lossy, and a unique \
                        hybrid compression mode. Although the technology is \
                        loosely based on previous versions of WavPack, the new \
                        version 4 format has been designed from the ground up \
                        to offer unparalleled performance and functionality.
