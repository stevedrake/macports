long_description	\
    Disk based hashes is a method to create multidimensional binary trees on disk. \
    This library permits the extension of database concept to a plethora of \
    electronic data, such as graphic information. With the multidimensional binary \
    tree it is possible to mathematically prove that access time to any \
    particular record is minimized (using the concept of critical points from \
    calculus), which provides the means to construct optimized databases for \
    particular applications.
