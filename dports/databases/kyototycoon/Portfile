description         Kyoto Tycoon is a lightweight database server.

long_description    \
    Kyoto Tycoon is a lightweight database server  with  auto  expiration \
    mechanism,  which  is  useful  to  handle  cache  data   of   various \
    applications.  Kyoto Tycoon is also a package of network interface to \
    the DBM called Kyoto Cabinet. Though the DBM has high performance and \
    high concurrency,  you might bother in case that  multiple  processes \
    share the same database,  or remote processes  access  the  database. \
    Thus, Kyoto Tycoon is provided for concurrent and remote  connections \
    to Kyoto Cabinet.  Kyoto Tycoon is composed  of  the  server  process \
    managing  multiple  databases  and  its  access  library  for  client \
    applications.
