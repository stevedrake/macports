description Official C++ client API for PostgreSQL

long_description \
    libpqxx is the official C++ client API for PostgreSQL, \
    the enterprise-strength open-source database software. \
    There are many similar libraries for PostgreSQL and for other \
    databases, some of them database independent.  Most of these, however, \
    are fairly C like in their programming style, and fail to take \
    advantage of the full power of the C++ language as it has matured \
    since the acceptance of the Standard in 1996.  What libpqxx brings you \
    is effective use of templates to reduce the inconvenience of dealing \
    with type conversions, standard C++ strings to keep you from having \
    to worry about buffer allocation and overflow attacks, exceptions \
    to take the tedious and error prone plumbing around error handling out \
    of your hands, constructors and destructors to bring resource \
    management under control, and even basic object orientation to give \
    you some extra reliability features that would be hard to get with \
    most other database interfaces.
