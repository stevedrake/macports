description		an embedded SQL database engine
long_description	SQLite is an SQL database engine in a C library. \
					Programs that link the SQLite library can have SQL \
					database access without running a separate RDBMS \
					process.  The distribution comes with a standalone \
					command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used \
					to administer an SQLite database and which serves as \
					an example of how to use the SQLite library.
