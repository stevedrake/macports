description      GNU arch - revision control system
long_description \
	GNU arch is a revision control system, similar in purpose to \
	tools such as CVS, SCCS, and Subversion. It is used to keep \
	track of the changes made to a source tree and to help \
	programmers combine and otherwise manipulate changes made by \
	multiple people or at different times.
