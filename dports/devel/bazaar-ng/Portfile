description		Python implementation of the GNU arch RCS protocol by Canonical
long_description	Bazaar-NG is an implementation of GNU arch from Canonical \
			written in Python. Arch is a version control system, which allows \
			you to keep old versions of files and directories (usually source \
			code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., \
			like SVN, CVS, or RCS. Arch is distributed, which gives it \
			significant advantages and some disadvantages compared to SVN and \
			CVS. The bzr implementation is the next Bazaar version from \
			Canonical called Bazaar-NG.
