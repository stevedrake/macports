description		Python implementation of the GNU arch RCS protocol by Canonical
long_description	Bazaar-NG is an implementation of GNU arch from Canonical \
    written in Python. Arch is a version control system, which allows \
    you to keep old versions of files and directories (usually source \
    code), keep a log of who, when, and why changes occurred, etc., \
    like SVN, CVS, or RCS. Arch is distributed, which gives it \
    significant advantages and some disadvantages compared to SVN and \
    CVS. The bzr implementation is the next Bazaar version from \
    Canonical called Bazaar-NG.
