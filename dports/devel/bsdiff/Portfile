description      Generates and applies patches to binary files
long_description \
	This is a pair of tools for building (bsdiff) and applying (bspatch) \
	binary patches. When applied to two versions of the same executable \
	the patches produced are significantly smaller than those generated \
	by other binary diff tools (eg, xdelta).
