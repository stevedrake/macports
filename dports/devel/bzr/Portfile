description   The next-generation distributed version control system
long_description  Bazaar is an open source distributed version control \
    system that is powerful, friendly, and scalable. It manages trees of \
    files and subdirectories, In particular, it records revisions of trees, \
    representing their state at a particular point in time, and information \
    about those revisions and their relationships. Recording and retrieving \
    tree revisions is useful in several ways if you are writing software or \
    documents or doing similar creative work.
