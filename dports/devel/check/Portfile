description			C unit testing framework
long_description		Check is a unit test framework for C. It \
				features a simple interface for defining unit \
				tests, putting little in the way of the \
				developer. Tests are run in a separate address \
				space, so Check can catch both assertion \
				failures and code errors that cause \
				segmentation faults or other signals. The \
				output from unit tests can be used within \
				source code editors and IDEs.
