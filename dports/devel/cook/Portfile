long_description	\
	Cook is a tool for constructing files. It is given a \
	set of files to create, and recipes of how to create \
	them. In any non-trivial program there will be \
	prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to \
	creating any file, such as include files. Cook provides \
	a mechanism to define these.
