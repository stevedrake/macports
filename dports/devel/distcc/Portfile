description	Distributed C compiler
long_description	\
	distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code \
	across several machines on a network without requiring that \
	they share filesystems, have the same headers/libraries or have \
	syncronized clocks.  distcc should always generate the same \
	results as a local compile but is often 2 to 3 times faster.
