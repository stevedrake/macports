long_description \
	DParser is an simple but powerful tool for parsing.  You can specify \
	the form of the text to be parsed using a combination of regular \
	expressions and grammar productions. Because of the parsing technique \
	(technically a scannerless GLR parser based on the Tomita algorithm) \
	there are no restrictions. The grammar can be ambiguous, right or \
	left recursive, have any number of null productions, and because there \
	is no seperate tokenizer, can include whitespace in terminals and have \
	terminals which are prefixes of other terminals. DParser handles not \
	just well formed computer languages and data files, but just about any \
	wacky situation that occurs in the real world.
