description	EET is a library for writing sets of data.
long_description        EET is a tiny library designed to write an \
			arbitary set of chunks of data to a file and \
			optionally compress each chunk (very much like \
			a zip file) and allow fast random-access \
			reading of the file later on. It does not \
			do zip as a zip itself has more complexity \
			than is needed, and it was much simpler to \
			impliment this once here.
