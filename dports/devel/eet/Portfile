description             EET is a library for writing sets of data.

long_description        EET is a tiny library designed to write an \
                        arbitary set of chunks of data to a file and \
                        optionally compress each chunk (very much like \
                        a zip file) and allow fast random-access \
                        reading of the file later on. It does not \
                        do zip as a zip itself has more complexity \
                        than is needed, and it was much simpler to \
                        impliment this once here.
