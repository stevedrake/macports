description	A C like scripting language
long_description        Embryo implements a C like scripting language \
			used in various parts of the Enlightenment project, \
			namely Edje. Embryo\'s scripting language is based \
			on CompuPhase\'s Small language that was introduced \
			in Dr Dobb\'s Journal in 1999. Embryo allows scripting \
			capabilities in places that otherwise wouldnt \
			support basic programming structures such as in Edje EDCs.
