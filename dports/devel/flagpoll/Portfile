long_description  Flagpoll is a tool for developers to use \
                  meta-data files for storing information \
                  on what is needed to compile their software.\
                  Think of it as the rpm of software development.\
                  It enables developers total control over \
                  which packages, versions, architectures, etc. \
                  that they want to use meta-data from.
