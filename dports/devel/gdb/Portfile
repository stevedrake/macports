description     GDB: The GNU Project Debugger

long_description \
GDB, the GNU Project debugger, allows you to see what is going on 'inside' \
another program while it executes -- or what another program was doing at the \
moment it crashed.  GDB can do four main kinds of things (plus other things \
in support of these) to help you catch bugs in the act: \
    a) start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior, \
    b) make your program stop on specified conditions, \
    c) examine what has happened, when your program has stopped, \
    d) change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting \
       the effects of one bug and go on to learn about another. \
The program being debugged can be written in Ada, C, C++, Objective-C, \
Pascal (and many other languages). Those programs might be executing on \
the same machine as GDB (native) or on another machine (remote). GDB \
can run on most popular UNIX and Microsoft Windows variants.
