description     A fast and lightweight GTK+ IDE
long_description Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development \
                environment. It was developed to provide a small and fast \
                IDE, which has only a few dependencies from other packages. \
                Another goal was to be as independent as possible from a \
                special Desktop Environment like KDE or GNOME.
