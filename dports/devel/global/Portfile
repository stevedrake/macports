description      source code tag system
long_description \
	GNU GLOBAL is a source code tag system that works the \
	same way across diverse environments. You can locate a \
	specified object in the source files and move there \
	easily. It is useful for hacking a large project \
	containing many subdirectories, many #ifdef and many \
	main() functions. It is similar to ctags or etags but \
	is different from them at the point of independence of \
	any editor.
