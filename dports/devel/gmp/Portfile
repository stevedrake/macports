platforms	darwin freebsd
description	GNU multiple precision arithmetic library
long_description	\
		GNU MP is a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic,	\
		operating on signed integers, rational numbers, and	\
		floating point numbers.  It has a rich set of		\
		functions, and the functions have a regular interface.	\
		GNU MP is designed to be as fast as possible, both for	\
		small operands and for huge operands.  The speed is	\
		achieved by using fullwords as the basic arithmetic	\
		type, by using fast algorithms, by carefully optimized	\
		assembly code for the most common inner loops for a	\
		lots of CPUs, and by a general emphasis on speed	\
		(instead of simplicity or elegance).
