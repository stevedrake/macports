long_description	Make is a tool which controls the generation of \
			executables and other non-source files of a program from \
			the program's source files. Make gets its knowledge of \
			how to build your program from a file called the makefile, \
			which lists each of the non-source files and how to \
			compute it from other files. When you write a program, you \
			should write a makefile for it, so that it is possible to \
			use Make to build and install the program.
