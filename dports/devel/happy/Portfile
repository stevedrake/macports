description	The Parser Generator for Haskell
long_description	\
		Happy is a parser generator system for Haskell,		\
		similar to the tool `yacc' for C. Like `yacc', it	\
		takes a file containing an annotated BNF specification	\
		of a grammar and produces a Haskell module containing	\
		a parser for the grammar.				\
									\
		Happy is flexible: you can have several Happy parsers	\
		in the same program, and several entry points to a	\
		single grammar. Happy can work in conjunction with a	\
		lexical analyser supplied by the user (either		\
		hand-written or generated by another program), or it	\
		can parse a stream of characters directly (but this	\
		isn't practical in most cases).
