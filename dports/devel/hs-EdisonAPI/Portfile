description	A library of purely functional data structures for Haskell
long_description	\
		Edison is a library of purely function data structures	\
		for Haskell originally written by Chris Okasaki.	\
		Conceptually, it consists of two things:		\
									\
   			1. A set of type classes defining data the	\
			   following data structure abstractions:	\
			   sequences, collections and associative	\
			   collections,					\
   			2. Multiple concrete implementations of each	\
			   of the abstractions.

#
# This portfile installs the Edison API package, which defines the Edison
# interface.  It is a prerequisite for the installation of the Edison
# package itself.
#
# This port downloads the same file as the Edison port, beacuse Edison
# is unusually packaged, with two separate packages in the same tarball.
