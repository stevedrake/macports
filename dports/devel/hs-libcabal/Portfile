description	Library for Haskell's Cabal build system.
long_description	\
		Cabal is a system for building and packaging Haskell	\
		libraries and programs It defines a common interface	\
		for package authors and distributors to easily build	\
		their applications in a portable way. Cabal is part of	\
		a larger infrastructure for distributing, organizing,	\
		and cataloging Haskell libraries and programs.		\
		    	       	       		     			\
		This port provides only the library.  The hs-cabal	\
		port provides the "cabal" installer program.
