description         ACE is an object-oriented framework that implements many core patterns for \
                    concurrent communication software.
long_description    The ADAPTIVE Communication Environment (ACE) is a freely available, \
                    open-source object-oriented (OO) framework that implements many core \
                    patterns for concurrent communication software. ACE provides a rich set \
                    of reusable C++ wrapper facades and framework components that perform \
                    common communication software tasks across a range of OS platforms. The \
                    communication software tasks provided by ACE include event \
                    demultiplexing and event handler dispatching, signal handling, service \
                    initialization, interprocess communication, shared memory management, \
                    message routing, dynamic (re)configuration of distributed services, \
                    concurrent execution and synchronization.
