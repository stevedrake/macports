long_description \
	libdvdnav is a library that allows easy use of sophisticated DVD \
	navigation features such as DVD menus, multiangle playback and even \
	interactive DVD games. \
	All this functionality is provided through a simple API which provides \
	the DVD playback as a single logical stream of blocks, intermitted by \
	special dvdnav events to report certain conditions. The main usage of \
	libdvdnav is a loop regularly calling a function to get the next block, \
	surrounded by additional calls to tell the library of user interaction. \
	The whole DVD virtual machine and internal playback states are completely \
	encapsulated.
