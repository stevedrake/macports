PortSystem 1.0
name		libevent
version		1.0b
categories	devel
maintainers	fkr@opendarwin.org
description	asynchronous event library
long_description	\
    The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function \
    when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout \
    has been reached.libevent is meant to replace the asynchronous event \
    loop found in event driven network servers. An application just \
    needs to call event_dispatch() and can then add or remove events \
    dynamically without having to change the event loop.
