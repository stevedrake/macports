description     libIDL is a library for creating CORBA IDL files. 

long_description \
    libIDL is a library licensed under the GNU LGPL \
    for creating trees of CORBA Interface Definition \
    Language (IDL) files, which is a specification \
    for defining portable interfaces. libIDL was \
    initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the \
    GNOME project, and the primary means of libIDL \
    distribution).  However, the functionality was \
    designed to be as reusable and portable as possible.
