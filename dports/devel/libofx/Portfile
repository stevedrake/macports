description		A parser and an API designed to allow applications \
			to very easily support OFX command responses
long_description	This is the LibOFX library. It is a parser and an API \
			designed to allow applications to very easily support \
			OFX command responses, usually provided by financial \
			institutions for statement downloads. To my knowledge, \
			it is the first working OpenSource implementation of \
			the OFX (Open Financial eXchange) specification on \
			the client side. This project was first started as \
			my end of degree project, with the objective to add \
			OFX support to GnuCash. It since evolved into a \
			generic library, so all OpenSource Financial \
			software can benefit.
