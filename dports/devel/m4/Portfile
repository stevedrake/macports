description     GNU macro processor 
long_description        GNU `m4' is an implementation of the traditional Unix \
			macro processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible, \
			although it has some extensions (for example, \
			handling more than 9 positional parameters to macros).\
			`m4' also has built-in functions for including files,\
			running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc. \
			Autoconf needs GNU `m4' for generating `configure' \
			scripts, but not for running them.
