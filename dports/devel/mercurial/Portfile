description         A fast, lightweight, distributed SCM system written in \
                    Python.
long_description    Mercurial is a fast, lightweight Source Control Management \
                    system designed for efficient handling of very large \
                    distributed projects. A distributed SCM tool is designed \
                    to support a model in which each Repository is loosely \
                    coupled to many others. Each Repository contains a \
                    complete set of metadata describing one or more projects. \
                    These repositories may be located almost anywhere. \
                    Individual developers only need access to their own \
                    repositories, not to a central one, in order to commit \
                    changes. Changes can be share via the builtin webserver, \
                    CGI, SSH or a stream of patch emails. Mercurial supports \
                    Apples' FileMerge for merges.\
