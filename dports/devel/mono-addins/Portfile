description     Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible applications

long_description \
    Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible applications, \
    and for creating libraries which extend those applications. \
    Mono.Addins has been designed to be easy to use and useful for a \
    wide range of applications: from simple applications with small \
    extensibility needs, to complex applications which need support \
    for large add-in structures.  This new framework intends to set an \
    standard for building extensible applications and add-ins in Mono.
