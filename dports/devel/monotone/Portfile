description      A distributed version control system
long_description \
       monotone is a free distributed version control system. It provides \
       a simple, single-file transactional version store, with fully \
       disconnected operation and an efficient peer-to-peer synchronization \
       protocol. It understands history-sensitive merging, lightweight \
       branches, integrated code review and 3rd party testing.
