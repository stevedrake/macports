description	Encode data in an efficient yet extensible format.

long_description \
		Google Protocol Buffers are a flexible, efficient, \
		automated mechanism for serializing structured data -- \
		think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.  You \
		define how you want your data to be structured once, \
		then you can use special generated source code to \
		easily write and read your structured data to and from \
		a variety of data streams and using a variety of \
		languages.  You can even update your data structure \
		without breaking deployed programs that are compiled \
		against the "old" format.  You specify how you want \
		the information you're serializing to be structured by \
		defining protocol buffer message types in .proto \
		files.  Each protocol buffer message is a small \
		logical record of information, containing a series of \
		name-value pairs.
