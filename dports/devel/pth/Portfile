long_description \
	Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms \
	which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple \
	threads of execution ("multithreading") inside server applications. All \
	threads run in the same address space of the server application, but \
	each thread has it's own individual program-counter, run-time stack, \
	signal mask and errno variable.
