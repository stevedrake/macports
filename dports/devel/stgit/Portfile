description         Push/pop utility on top of GIT
long_description    StGIT is a Python application providing similar \
                    functionality to Quilt (i.e. pushing/popping patches \
                    to/from a stack) on top of GIT. These operations are \
                    performed using GIT commands and the patches are stored \
                    as GIT commit objects, allowing easy merging of the StGIT \
                    patches into other repositories using standard GIT \
                    functionality. \
                    Note that StGIT is not an SCM interface on top of GIT and \
                    it expects a previously initialised GIT repository \
                    (unless it is cloned using StGIT directly). For standard \
                    SCM operations, either use plain GIT commands or the \
                    Cogito tool but it is not recommended to mix them with \
                    the StGIT commands.
