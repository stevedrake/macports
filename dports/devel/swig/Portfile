description	Tool to wrap C/C++ libraries in high-level languages.
long_description	\
    SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in C \
    and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is \
    primarily used with common scripting languages such as Perl, Python, \
    Tcl/Tk, Ruby, Guile and MzScheme, however the list of supported languages \
    also includes non-scripting languages such as Java and OCAML. SWIG is \
    most commonly used to create high-level interpreted programming \
    environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and \
    prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG may be freely used, distributed, and \
    modified for commercial and noncommercial use.
