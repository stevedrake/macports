long_description \
    ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display,       \
    modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via  \
    shell scripts. A restricted version of ed, red, can only edit files in  \
    the current directory and cannot execute shell commands. ed is the      \
    standard text editor in the sense that it is the original editor for    \
    Unix, and thus widely available. For most purposes, however, it is      \
    superseded by full-screen editors such as Emacs.
