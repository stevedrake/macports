description     ed is a line-oriented text editor.

long_description \
    ed is a line-oriented text editor. It is used to create, display, \
    modify and otherwise manipulate text files, both interactively and via \
    shell scripts. A restricted version of ed, red, can only edit files in \
    the current directory and cannot execute shell commands. ed is the \
    standard text editor in the sense that it is the original editor for \
    Unix, and thus widely available. For most purposes, however, it is \
    superseded by full-screen editors such as Emacs.
