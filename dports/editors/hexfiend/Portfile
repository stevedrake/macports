description HexFiend is a fast and clever hex editor

long_description    \
* Insert, delete, rearrange.  Hex Fiend is not limited to in-place changes like some hex editors.  * Work with huge files.  Hex Fiend can handle as big a file as you're able to create. It's been tested on files as large as 118 GB.  * Small footprint.  Hex Fiend does not need to keep your files in memory. You won't dread launching or working with Hex Fiend even on low-RAM machines.  * Fast.  Open a huge file, scroll around, copy and paste, all instantly. Find what you're looking for with fast searching.  * Smart saving.  Hex Fiend knows not to waste time overwriting the parts of your files that haven't changed.  * Data inspector.  Interpret data as integer or floating point, signed or unsigned, big or little endian...  * Smooth scrolling.  No separate pages - scroll like any text document.
