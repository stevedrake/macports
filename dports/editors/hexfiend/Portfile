description     HexFiend is a fast and clever hex editor

long_description \n\
    * Insert, delete, rearrange. Hex Fiend is not limited to in-place changes like some hex editors.\n\
    * Work with huge files. Hex Fiend can handle as big a file as you're able to create. It's been tested on files as \
      large as 118 GB.\n\
    * Small footprint. Hex Fiend does not need to keep your files in memory. You won't dread launching or working with \
       Hex Fiend even on low-RAM machines.\n\
    * Fast. Open a huge file, scroll around, copy and paste, all instantly. Find what you're looking for with fast \
       searching.\
    * Smart saving. Hex Fiend knows not to waste time overwriting the parts of your files that haven't changed.\n\
    * Data inspector. Interpret data as integer or floating point, signed or unsigned, big or little endian...\n\
    * Smooth scrolling. No separate pages - scroll like any text document.
