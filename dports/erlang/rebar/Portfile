description	Rebar is an Erlang build tool that makes it easy to compile \
                    and test Erlang applications, port drivers and releases.
long_description    Rebar is a self-contained Erlang script, so it's easy to \
                    distribute or even embed directly in a project. Where possible, \
                    Rebar uses standard Erlang/OTP conventions for project \
                    structures, thus minimizing the amount of build configuration \
                    work. Rebar also provides dependency management, enabling \
                    application writers to easily re-use common libraries from a \
                    variety of locations (Git, Hg, etc).
