description         Console-based Z-Machine interpreter for Infocom games.
long_description    Fizmo is a Z-Machine interpreter (Fizmo Interprets \
                    Z-Machine Opcodes) which allows you to run Infocom- and \
                    most other Z-Machine based games -- except version 6 -- on \
                    POSIX-like systems which provide a ncursesw (note the 'w') \
                    library. It has been successfully compiled on Debian based \
                    Linux, Mac OS X (with MacPorts providing ncursesw) and \
                    Windows (using Cygwin and a self-compiled ncursesw \
                    library). This is a console-style application, meaning \
                    that it runs in textmode and does not provide any GUI \
                    whatsoever. For more information about Infocom and \
                    interactive fiction, see the 'New to IF' section at \
                    http://www.ifarchive.org. Games are available from \
