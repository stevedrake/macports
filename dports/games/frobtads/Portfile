description			FrobTADS is a new version of TADS for Unix
long_description	FrobTADS is a complete rewrite of the Unix version. It \
adds support for a number of relatively recent TADS features that were \
missing from the old Unix version, including full support for text and \
background colors, TADS 3 banners, and timed input. It's also much more \
portable and more easily maintainable, as it's built to modern Unix \
standards. And installing FrobTADS is greatly simplified compared to the old \
Unix port, thanks to automatic configuration.
