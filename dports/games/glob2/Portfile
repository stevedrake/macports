description         Globulation 2 - a free and innovative strategy game
long_description    Globulation 2 is an innovative high quality Real-Time \
                    Strategy, which minimizes micro-management by \
                    automatically assigning tasks to the units. The player \
                    has to choose the number of units he wants for the \
                    different tasks, and the units will do their best to \
                    satisfy the requests. This allows to manage more units \
                    and to focus on the strategy. It can be played alone, \
                    through your Local Area Network, or through Internet \
                    thanks to Ysagoon Online Game, a meta-server. It also \
                    features a scripting language for versatile gameplay or \
                    tutorials and an integrated map editor.
