long_description \
    Lincity is a city simulation game. You are required to build and \
    maintain a city. You must feed, house, provide jobs and goods for \
    your residents. You can build a sustainable economy with the help \
    of renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for broke and \
    build rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource \
    starved planet, it's up to you.
