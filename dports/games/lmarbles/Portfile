version		1.0.7
categories	games
platforms	darwin
maintainers	mww@opendarwin.org
description	Atomix clone with slight change in concept.
long_description	LMarbles is an Atomix clone with a slight change in \
			concept. Instead of assembling molecules you create \
			figures out of marbles. Nevertheless, the basic game \
			play is the same: If a marble starts to move it will \
			not stop until it hits a wall or another marble. To \
			make it more interesting there are obstacles like \
			one-way streets, crumbling walls and portals. \
			As Marbles is meant as a puzzle game you play against \
			a move limit and not a time limit. This way you have \
			as much time as you need to think.
