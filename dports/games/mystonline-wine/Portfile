notes                       Welcome to Myst Online: Uru Live Again (MO:ULagain) \
                            \n\n* To play Myst Online, you need an account, which you can create for free by visiting \
                            ${homepage} and clicking Play. \
                            \n* Myst Online automatically updates itself. \
                            The first time you open Myst Online, it will download several gigabytes of game data. \
                            Be patient\; this will take some time. \
                            If you already have the game data from a non-MacPorts installation of Myst Online, \
                            you can save time by copying or moving it into ${assets_dir} \
                            \n\nThis version of Myst Online runs via Wine. \
                            Peculiarities of this method of running Myst Online include: \
                            \n* Don't click anywhere in the updater window. If you do, the window will follow the mouse \
                            cursor and will not go away. If you need to cancel the updater, press the Escape key. \
                            \n* The first time you log into Myst Online, you will be prompted to install PhysX. \
                            \n* The mouse cursor image is wrong. \
                            \n* To be able to look around by holding down the Command key while dragging, \
                            enable the \"Emulate three button mouse\" option in X11 preferences. \
                            \n* The menubar cannot be hidden. \
                            \n* The dock does not hide automatically. It can be hidden using the normal ways \
                            (e.g. Apple menu > Dock > Turn hiding on) but you may also want to move the dock \
                            to the side of the screen as otherwise it gets in the way of game play. \
                            \n* The game's dock icon keeps bouncing longer than it should, doesn't show that \
                            it's running even when it is, and doesn't bring the game to the front if you click it. \
                            \n* Accessing the dock icon's context menu doesn't let you quit the game normally, \
                            though it does let you force-quit it. \
                            \n* The application has a generic icon. \
                            \n* The game starts in fullscreen mode. If in fullscreen mode you access the game's \
                            graphics settings, you cannot return to the game\; you must force-quit. \
                            \n* To switch between fullscreen and windowed mode, use the checkbox in the graphics settings. \
                            \n* Intel GMA 950 integrated graphics cards are not supported. Some graphics including your avatar \
                            will not display correctly. \
                            \n* Sounds sometimes pop and crackle. \
                            \n* The microphone cannot be used to talk to other players, though you can hear other players talking to you. \
                            \n* On Macs with NVIDIA graphics cards that have not upgraded to Mac OS X 10.6.3, \
                            Eder Kemo has severe performance problems. \
                            \n\nOther methods of running Myst Online on a Mac include the Cider version in the \
                            mystonline-cider port, and running the game in Windows via VMware, Parallels or Boot Camp. \
                            \n\nTo play Myst Online, open ${app_package}.
