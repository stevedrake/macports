long_description        2D Space Shooter\; after decades of war one company, \
                        who had gained powerful supply both sides with \
                        weaponary, steps forwards and crushes both warring \
                        factions in one swift movement. Using far superior \
                        weaponary and AI craft, the company was completely \
                        unstoppable and now no one can stand in their way. \
                        Thousands began to perish under the iron fist of the \
                        company. The people cried out for a saviour, for \
                        someone to light this dark hour... and someone did.
