description         Wormux is a Worms-clone.
long_description    \
    Wormux is free software clone of this game concept. Though currently under heavy \
    development, it is already very playable, with lots of weapons (Dynamite, Baseball \
    Bat, Teleportation, etc.). There are also lots of maps available for your battling \
    pleasure! Wormux takes the genre to the next level, with great customisation options \
    leading to great gameplay. There is a wide selection of teams, from the Aliens to \
    the Chickens. Also, new battlefields can be downloaded from the Internet, making \
    strategy an important part of each battle. Though two human players are currently \
    needed to play (unless you have a split personality :) the creation of artificial \
    players and network play are work-in-progress goals.
