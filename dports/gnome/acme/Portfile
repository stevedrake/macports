description	Tool to make multimedia keys work on laptops
long_description  	This is ACME, a small tool for your laptops. \
			It makes the small multimedia buttons on these \
			things actually do something. It currently only \
			fully supports Apple laptops (iBooks and \
			Powerbooks), and should work on other systems as well.
