description                     GRAMPS is a genealogy program

long_description                GRAMPS is a genealogy program to store, edit, \
                                and research genealogical data.  It provides \
                                advanced capabilities for research, analysis, and \
                                correlation to potentially fill relationship gaps.

notes \
"
        NOTE 1: Some users have experienced problems importing databases
                from Gramps version 2 or from 3.1.x. It is advised that
                databases are exported from Gramps version 2 in Gramps
                XML format before updating to Gramps version 3.
                The Gramps XML export from version 2 can then be imported
                into gramps 3 if the automatic database upgrade does not work.

        NOTE 2: The WriteCD plugin is unavailable. This relies on GNOME and
                has not yet been made to work on OS X.

        NOTE 3: The Geography View is not available because MacPorts webkit-gtk does
                not provide geolocation services via GeoClue.
