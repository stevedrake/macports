description     GD creates PNG and JPEG images, among other formats
long_description	gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to \
			quickly draw images complete with lines, arcs, text, \
			multiple colors, cut and paste from other images, and \
			flood fills, and write out the result as a .PNG file. \
			This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, \
			where .PNG is the format used for inline images. \
			gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint \
			program, you are looking in the wrong place. \
			If you are not a programmer, you are looking in the wrong \
			place.
