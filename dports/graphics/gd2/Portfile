description     GD creates PNG and JPEG images, among other formats
long_description    gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to \
            quickly draw images complete with lines, arcs, text, \
            multiple colors, cut and paste from other images, and \
            flood fills, and write out the result as a .PNG file. \
            This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, \
            where .PNG is the format used for inline images. \
            gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint \
            program, you are looking in the wrong place. \
            If you are not a programmer, you are looking in the wrong \
            place.
