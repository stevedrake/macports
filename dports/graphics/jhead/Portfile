description		Program for extracting Digicam setting information from Exif Jpeg headers.

long_description	${name} is used to display and manipulate data contained in \
				the Exif header of jpeg images from digital cameras. By \
				default, jhead displays the more useful camera settings \
				from the file in a user friendly format. \
				jhead can also be used to manipulate some aspects of the \
				image relating to jpeg and Exif headers, such as changing \
				the internal timestamps, removing the thumbnail, or \
				transferring Exif headers back into edited images after \
				graphical editors deleted the exif header. jhead can also \
				be used to launch other programs, similar in style to \
				the UNIX find command, but much simpler.
