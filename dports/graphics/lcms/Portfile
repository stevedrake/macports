    LCMS is the Little Color Management System, a Color Matching Method \
    (CMM) library which implements fast transforms between ICC profiles. \
    It is released under LGPL with source code and meant to be portable. \

    as images are transferred from scanners or cameras to monitors and \
    printers.
