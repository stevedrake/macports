long_description  Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics. \
		It supports a very powerful imaging model, basically the \
		same as SVG and the Java 2D API. It includes all \
		PostScript imaging operations, and adds antialiasing and \
		alpha-transparency. It is also highly tuned for \
		incremental rendering. It contains data structures and \
		algorithms suited to rapid, precise computation of Region \
		of Interest, and a two-phase rendering pipeline optimized \
		for interactive display.
