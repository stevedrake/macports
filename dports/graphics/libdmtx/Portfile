long_description \
  libdmtx is open source software for reading and writing Data Matrix \
  barcodes. Data Matrix barcodes are two-dimensional symbols that hold a \
  dense pattern of data with built-in error correction. The Data Matrix \
  symbology (sometimes casually referred to as DataMatrix) was \
  invented and released into the public domain by RVSI Acuity CiMatrix. \
  Wikipedia has a good article on the symbology and its characteristics.
