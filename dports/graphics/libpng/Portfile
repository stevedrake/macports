description \
    Library for manipulating PNG images

long_description \
    Libpng was written as a companion to the PNG specification, as a \
    way to reduce the amount of time and effort it takes to support \
    the PNG file format in application programs.  Most users will not \
    have to modify the library significantly, advanced users may want \
    to modify it more.  The library was coded for both users.  All \
    attempts were made to make it as complete as possible, while \
    keeping the code easy to understand.  Currently, this library \
    only supports C.  Support for other languages is being considered.
