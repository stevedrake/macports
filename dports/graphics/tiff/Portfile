description	Library and tools for dealing with Tag Image File Format
long_description \
	This software provides support for the Tag Image File 		\
	Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image 		\
	data.  Included in this software distribution is a 		\
	library, libtiff, for reading and writing TIFF, a small 	\
	collection of tools for doing simple manipulations of 		\
	TIFF images on UNIX systems, documentation on the library 	\
	and tools.  A small assortment of TIFF-related software 	\
	for UNIX that has been contributed by others is also 		\
	included.  The library is capable of dealing with images 	\
	that are written to follow the 5.0 or 6.0 TIFF spec. 		\
	There is also considerable support for some of the more 	\
	esoteric portions of the 6.0 TIFF spec.
