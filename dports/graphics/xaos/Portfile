description      real-time interactive fractal zoomer
long_description \
    XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer. \
    It displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time fractals) \
    and allows you zoom smoothly into the fractal. Various coloring \
    modes are provided for both the points inside and outside the \
    selected set. In addition, switching between Julia and Mandelbrot \
    fractal types and on-the-fly plane switching is provided. The \
    first version was a minimal X Window Mandelbrot viewer by Thomas \
    later modified by Jan to support high frame-rate zooming. Other \
    additions were later made by both Thomas and Jan including \
    autopilot (for those of you without drivers licenses), palette \
    changing, GIF saving, and fractal inversion.
