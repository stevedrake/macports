long_description \
	EPIC5 is the new development branch of EPIC, which is a \
	new direction in ircII development. No longer is EPIC 100% \
	backwards compatable with ircII, but instead we have chosen \
	to find those things where compatability is undesirable, \
	and fix them. No gratuitous incompatabilities have been \
	added, but lots of new code has been added to make EPIC the \
	best ircII client we could make.
