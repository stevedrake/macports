description             Database migrations written in Scala

long_description        Scala Migrations is a library to manage upgrades and \
                        rollbacks to database schemas.  Migrations allow a \
                        source control system to manage together the database \
                        schema and the code using the schema.  It is designed \
                        to allow multiple developers working on a project with \
                        a database backend to design schema modifications \
                        independently, apply the migrations to their local \
                        database for debugging and when complete, check them \
                        into a source control system to manage as one manages \
                        normal source code.  Other developers then check out \
                        the new migrations and apply them to their local \
                        database.  Finally, the migrations are used to migrate \
                        the production databases to the latest schema version. \
                        The Scala Migrations library is written in Scala and \
                        makes use of the clean Scala language to write easy to \
                        understand migrations, which are also written in \
                        Scala.  Scala Migrations provides a database \
                        abstraction layer that allows migrations to target any \
                        supported database vendor.
