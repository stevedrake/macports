So far known problems are:                          \n \
 - chart reports let the app hang                   \n \
 - balance and net worth charts w/o axis lines      \n \
 - in some cases it doesn't get installed properly  \n \
 - it may not start up (jumping icon in dock)       \n \
 - KBanking is not yet enabled                      \n \
                                                    \n \
Start application from                              \n \
\  ${prefix}/Applications/KDE4/kmymoney.app         \n \
                                                    \n \
Some systems have problems finding phonon, in that  \n \
case define the fallback library search path:       \n \
\  export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=${prefix}/lib  \n \
                                                    \n \
In case kmymoney.app doesn't start up, launch the   \n \
app's executable from a terminal window             \n \
                                                    \n \
\  .../kmymoney.app/Contents/MacOS/kmymoney         \n \
                                                    \n \
and watch its console output!                       \n \
                                                    \n \
