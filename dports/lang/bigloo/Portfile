description	  Bigloo is a fast Scheme implementation.
long_description  Bigloo is a Scheme implementation devoted to one goal: \
    		  enabling Scheme based programming style where C(++) is \
		  usually required. Bigloo attempts to make Scheme practical \
		  by offering features usually presented by traditional \
		  programming languages but not offered by Scheme and \
		  functional programming. Bigloo compiles Scheme modules. \
    		  It delivers small and fast standalone binary executables. \
		  Bigloo enables full connections between Scheme and C programs, \
		  between Scheme and Java programs, and between Scheme and \
		  C# programs.
