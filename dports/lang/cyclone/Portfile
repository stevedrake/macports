description	safe programming language based on C
long_description	Cyclone is a programming language based on C that is \
			safe, meaning that it rules out programs that have \
			buffer overflows, dangling pointers, format string \
			attacks, and so on. High-level, type-safe languages, \
			such as Java, Scheme, or ML also provide safety, but \
			they don't give the same control over data \
			representations and memory management that C does \
			(witness the fact that the run-time systems for these \
			languages are usually written in C.) Furthermore, \
			porting legacy C code to these languages or \
			interfacing with legacy C libraries is a difficult and \
			error-prone process. The goal of Cyclone is to give \
			programmers the same low-level control and performance \
			of C without sacrificing safety, and to make it easy \
			to port or interface with legacy C code.
