description		general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax
long_description	GPP is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable \
				syntax, suitable for a wide range of preprocessing tasks. Its \
				independence from any programming language makes it much more \
				versatile than cpp, while its syntax is lighter and more \
				flexible than that of m4. The syntax is fully customizable, \
				which makes it possible to process text files, HTML, or source \
				code equally efficiently in a variety of languages.
