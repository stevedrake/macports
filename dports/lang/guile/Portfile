description	GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extension (guile)
long_description	\
		Guile is an interpreter for the Scheme programming language, \
		packaged for use in a wide variety of environments.  \
		Guile implements Scheme as described in the Revised^5 Report \
		on the Algorithmic Language Scheme (usually known as R5RS), \
		providing clean and general data and control structures.  \
		Guile goes beyond the rather austere language presented \
		in R5RS, extending it with a module system, full access to \
		POSIX system calls, networking support, multiple threads, \
		dynamic linking, a foreign function call interface, \
		powerful string processing, and many other features needed \
		for programming in the real world.

#bugs		On Apple's darwin, the putenv library function acts \
#		differently than the GNU version. The patch to \
#		libguile/posix.c fixes this, so the guile 'putenv' \
#		function doesn't throw a system error.

#user_notes	Set DLYD_LIBRARY_PATH to /opt/local/lib (or wherever \
#		the guile libraries have been installed) if you intend \
#		to load guile modules.
