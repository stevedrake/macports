description	The nhc98 Haskell Compiler
long_description	\
		nhc98 is a small, easy to install, standards-compliant	\
		compiler for Haskell 98, the lazy functional		\
		programming language.  It is very portable, and aims to	\
		produce small executables that run in small amounts of	\
		memory. It produces medium-fast code, and compilation	\
		is itself quite fast. It also comes with extensive tool	\
		support for automatic compilation, foreign language	\
		interfacing, heap and time profiling, tracing, and	\
		debugging.  (Some of its advanced kinds of heap		\
		profiles are not found in any other Haskell compiler.)
