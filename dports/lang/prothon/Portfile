description      industrial-strength alternative to Python and Self
long_description \
	Prothon is a fresh new language that gets rid of classes \
	altogether in the same way that Self does and regains the \
	original practical and fun sensibility of Python. This \
	major improvement plus many minor ones make for a clean \
	new revolutionary break in language development. Prothon \
	is quite simple and yet offers the power of Python and Self.
