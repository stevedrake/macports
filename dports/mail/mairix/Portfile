description		Email index and search tool
long_description	mairix is a program for indexing and searching email \
			messages stored in Maildir, MH or mbox folders.      \
			Indexing is fast. It runs incrementally on new       \
			messages - any particular message only gets scanned  \
			once in the lifetime of the index file. The search   \
			mode populates a "virtual" maildir (or MH) folder    \
			with symlinks which point to the real messages. This \
			folder can be opened as usual in your mail program.  \
			The search mode is very fast. Indexing and searching \
			works on the basis of words. The index file tabulates\
			which words occur in which parts (particular headers \
			+ body) of which messages.

# This patch resolves a conflict with /usr/include/stdio.h (defining
# _POSIX_C_SOURCE solves this problem, but introduces other ones, so
# a patch seems to be the best solution).
