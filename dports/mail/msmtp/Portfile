description	SMTP client that can be used as an SMTP plugin for Mutt
long_description	msmtp is an SMTP client that can be used as an SMTP \
			plugin for Mutt and probably other MUAs (mail user \
			agents). It forwards mails to an SMTP server which \
			does the delivery. To use this program, create a \
			configuration file with your mail account(s) and tell \
			your MUA to call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail.
