description		SMTP client that can be used as an SMTP plugin for Mutt
long_description	msmtp is an SMTP client that can be used as an SMTP \
				plugin for Mutt and probably other MUAs (mail user \
				agents). It forwards mails to an SMTP server which \
				does the delivery. To use this program, create a \
				configuration file with your mail account(s) and tell \
				your MUA to call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail.
