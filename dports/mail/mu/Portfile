long_description \
   mu is a set of command-line tools for Linux/Unix that enable you to \
   quickly find the e-mails you are looking for. First, a tool called \
   mu-index fills a database with information about all your e-mails. After \
   that, you can easily search for them, using mu-find and its dedicated \
   query language.
