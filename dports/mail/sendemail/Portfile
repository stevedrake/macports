description		lightweight, completly command line based SMTP email agent
long_description	sendemail is a lightweight, completly command line \
			based, SMTP email agent. If you have the need to send email \
			from a command prompt this tool is perfect. It was designed to \
			be used in bash scripts, Perl programs, and web sites, but it \
			is also quite useful in many other contexts.  sendemail is \
			written in Perl and is unique in that it requires no special \
			modules.
