description	GiNaC is Not a Computer algebra system
long_description	\
		Currently, GiNaC's capabilities include:		\
									\
		1. Very fast manipulation of large integers and		\
		   rationals owing to the CLN library (for instance,	\
		   it uses Karatsuba multiplication and			\
		   Schoenhage-Strassen multiplication for very large	\
		   integers).						\
		2. Efficient handling of multivariate polynomials and	\
		   rational functions.					\
		3. Support for linear algebra includes symbolic		\
		   matrices, vectors and solving equations.		\
		4. Very fast heuristic polynomial GCD.			\
		5. Many built in functions (sin, cos, atan, sinh,	\
		   factorial, etc.)					\
		6. Symbolic differentiation and series expansion of	\
		   all built-in functions.				\
		7. Several forms of output (also as optimized C++,	\
		   for numerical postprocessing).			\
		8. Memory-efficiency and -safety through the internal	\
		   use of reference counting for all expressions.
