description       A xemacs mode for interactive prooving
long_description  The aim of Proof General is to provide powerful \
                  and configurable interfaces which help user-interaction \
                  with proof assistants. Proof General targets power users \
                  rather than novices, but is designed to be useful to \
                  both. Proof General leads to an environment for \
                  serious proof engineering of interactively-constructed \
                  proofs.
