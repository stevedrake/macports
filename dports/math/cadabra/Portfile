long_description \
	Cadabra is a computer algebra system for the manipulation	\
	of what could loosely be called tensorial expressions. It is	\
	aimed at, though not necessarily restricted to, theoretical	\
	high energy physicists. Because of its target audience, the	\
	program's interface, storage system and underlying philosophy	\
	differ substantially from other computer algebra systems.
