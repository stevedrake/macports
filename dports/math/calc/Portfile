long_description \
	Calc is an interactive calculator which provides for easy \
	large numeric calculations, but which also can be easily \
	programmed for difficult or long calculations. It can \
	accept a command line argument, in which case it executes \
	that single command and exits. Otherwise, it enters \
	interactive mode. There are a great number of pre-defined \
	functions. The calculator can calculate transcendental \
	functions, and accept and display numbers in real or \
	exponential format. The calculator also knows about \
	complex numbers.
