long_description \
    Dap is a small statistics and graphics package based on C. \
    Version 3.0 of Dap can read SBS programs! The user wishing \
    to perform basic statistical analyses is now freed from \
    learning and using C syntax for straightforward tasks, \
    while retaining access to the C-style graphics and \
    statistics features provided by the original \
    implementation. Dap provides core methods of data \
    management, analysis, and graphics that are commonly used \
    in statistical consulting practice (univariate statistics, \
    correlations and regression, ANOVA, categorical data \
    analysis, logistic regression, and nonparametric analyses).
