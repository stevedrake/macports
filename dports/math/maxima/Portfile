description	The Maxima computer algebra system
long_description	\
		The Maxima computer algebra system is a descendant	\
		of DOE Macsyma, a version of MIT's Macsyma whose	\
		development was supported by the U.S. Department of	\
		Energy.							\
									\
		Through the effort of the late William Shelter of the	\
		University of Texas, it was released under the GNU	\
		General Public License. It is one of the more		\
		comprehensive and powerful computer algebra systems	\
		available as open source. 

#bugs		The graphical interfaces (xmaxima and the maxima	\
#		session	mode of TeXmacs) are still quite immature and	\
#		prone to hang.						\
#									\
#		The not all of the printable documentation can be built \
#		from the top level makefile yet. The printable_doc	\
#		variant	builds the reference manual in dvi format and	\
#		forces its installation into				\
#		${prefix}/share/maxima/<version>/doc/dvi.		\

#user_notes	Maxima now depends on openmcl, which builds very	\
#		reliably on darwin.  Clisp, which had been used, was	\
#		less than dependable because it assumed that the	\
#		underlying C library was GNU, rather than BSD.
