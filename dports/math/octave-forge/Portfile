long_description \
            (This port is obsolete.) \
            The GNU Octave Repository is a central location for the \
            collaborative development of packages for GNU Octave. \
            The octave-forge port has been discontinued, in favor \
            of several independent ports. \
            Please uninstall the octave-forge port, and install the \
            individual octave-* ports that suit your needs.
