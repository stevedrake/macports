description	Yet Another Computer Algebra System
long_description YACAS is an easy to use, general purpose Computer Algebra\
	System, a program for symbolic manipulation of mathematical\
	expressions. It uses its own programming language designed for\
	symbolic as well as arbitrary-precision numerical computations.  The\
	system has a library of scripts that implement many of the symbolic\
	algebra operations - new algorithms can be easily added to the library.
