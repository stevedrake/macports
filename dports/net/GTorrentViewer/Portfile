# There's a dep on intltool that still needs to be worked out. Apparently intltool itself is not really
# needed, but the XML::Parser perl module. Now, the correspondig dep forces the installation of the perl
# dport, which is of course undesirable only for that module (even less if you consider that Panther
# already has a quite up to date perl installation!). How can we get round this?
