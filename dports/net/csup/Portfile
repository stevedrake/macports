long_description	\
	Csup is a rewrite of CVSup in C. \
	CVSup(R) is a software for distributing and updating collections of files \
	accross a network. It can efficiently and accurately mirror all types of \
	files, including sources, binaries, hard links, symbolic links, and even \
	device nodes. In addition to being a great general-purpose mirroring tool, \
	CVSup includes special features and optimizations specifically tailored to \
	CVS repositories. It is being used as the preferred way to update sources \
	within the FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD projects and more.
