description	        lightweight DNS forwarder and DHCP server
long_description	Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS \
			        forwarder and DHCP server. It is designed to provide \
			        DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network. It can \
                    serve the names of local machines which are not in the \
                    global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS \
                    server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated \
                    addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured \
                    either in each host or in a central configuration \
                    file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases \
                    and BOOTP for network booting of diskless machines.
