long_description  \
          EtherApe is a graphical network monitor for Unix modeled after \
          etherman. Featuring link layer, ip and TCP modes, it displays network \
          activity graphically. Hosts and links change in size with traffic. \
          Color coded protocols display. It supports Ethernet, FDDI, Token \
          Ring, ISDN, PPP and SLIP devices. It can filter traffic to be shown, \
          and can read traffic from a file as well as live from the network.
