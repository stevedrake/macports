description		udp based alternate protocol for ftp, server and tools
long_description	FSP stands for File Service Protocol. It is a very \
				lightweight UDP based protocol for transferring files. FSP has \
				many benefits over FTP, mainly for running anonymous archives. \
				FSP protocol is valuable in all kinds of environments because \
				it is one of the only TCP/IP protocols that is not aggressive \
				about bandwidth, while still being sufficiently fault tolerant.
