long_description \
		fwknop stands for the 'FireWall KNock OPerator', and \
		implements an authorization scheme called Single \
		Packet Authorization (SPA) that is based around \
		Netfilter and libpcap.  SPA requires only a single \
		encrypted packet in order to communicate various \
		pieces of information including desired access through \
		a Netfilter policy and/or complete commands to execute \
		on the target system.  By using Netfilter to maintain \
		a 'default drop' stance, the main application of this \
		program is to protect services such as OpenSSH with an \
		additional layer of security in order to make the \
		exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and \
		unpatched code) much more difficult.  The \
		authorization server passively monitors authorization \
		packets via libcap and hence there is no 'server' to \
		which to connect in the traditional sense.  Access to \
		a protected service is only granted after a valid \
		encrypted and non-replayed packet is monitored.  This \
		port installs the client side script that you run to \
		gain access to a Linux box.
