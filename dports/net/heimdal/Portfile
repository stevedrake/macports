description	Kerberos is a network authentication protocol.

long_description	Kerberos provides a means of verifying the identities \
			of principals, (e.g., a workstation user or a network \
			server) on an open (unprotected) network.  This is \
			accomplished without relying on authentication by the \
			host operating system, without basing trust on host \
			addresses, without requiring physical security of all \
			the hosts on the network, and under the assumption \
			that packets traveling along the network can be read, \
			modified, and inserted at will.
