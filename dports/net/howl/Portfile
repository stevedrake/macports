long_description	Howl is a cross-platform implementation of Zeroconf \
			networking. \
			Branded as Rendezvous(tm) by Apple Computer, Inc., \
			Zeroconf standardizes networking protocols for \
			delivering hassle-free ad-hoc networking, service \
			discovery and IP configuration. This ease of use, \
			enjoyed by users of Mac OS X, is now available as an \
			SDK for Windows 2000/XP and many flavors of Unix. Howl \
			allows software developers to easily embed Zeroconf \
			functionality in their applications, making cumbersome \
			and error-prone network configuration tasks seem so \
			five minutes ago. Give your users what they want. Give \
			them simple, elegant networking. Give them Howl.
