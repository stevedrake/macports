description		network connection performance tracking monitor
long_description	ICPLD is a connection monitor which allows you to keep \
			track of your network connection perfomance. It will log each \
			occasion of broken networking. It runs as a background process, \
			and sends ICMP requests to an ip of your choice. When a reply \
			isn't received within proper amount of time, it will consider \
			the connection as unavailable and put a stamp in its log.
