description   Layer four traceroute capable of tracing protocol paths
long_description LFT, short for Layer Four Traceroute, is a \
    sort of 'traceroute' that often works much \
    faster (than the commonly-used Van Jacobson \
    method) and goes through many configurations \
    of packet-filter based firewalls. More \
    importantly, LFT implements numerous other \
    features including AS number lookups, \
    loose source routing, netblock name lookups,\
    et al.
