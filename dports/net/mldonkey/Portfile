description		OCaml/GTK client for the eDonkey p2p network
long_description	\
				MLdonkey is a multi-platform multi-network peer-to-peer client. \
				It supports several large networks, such as eDonkey, Overnet, \
				Bittorrent, Gnutella (Bearshare, Limewire, etc), Gnutella2 \
				(Shareaza), Fasttrack (Kazaa, Imesh, Grobster), Soulseek, \
				Direct-Connect, and Opennap. Networks can be enabled/disabled, \
				searches are performed in parallel on all enabled networks, but \
				each file is only downloaded from one network, but from multiple \
				clients concurrently.
