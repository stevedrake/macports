description		OCaml/GTK client for the eDonkey p2p network
long_description	\
				MLdonkey is a multi-platform multi-network peer-to-peer \
				client. It supports several large networks, such as eDonkey, Overnet, Bittorrent, Gnutella (Bearshare, Limewire, etc), \
				Gnutella2 (Shareaza), Fasttrack (Kazaa, Imesh, Grobster), \
				Soulseek, Direct-Connect, and Opennap. Networks can be \
				enabled/disabled, searches are performed in parallel on all \
				enabled networks, but each file is only downloaded from one \
				network, but from multiple clients concurrently.
