-BINARY vs. SHELL?
+TDK
+
+    Type make to compile the TDK.  The TDK creates a program called tdk.  tdk
+    is a stand alone program that does a single nefu test, and reports the
+    result.
+
+SHELL vs. BINARY
+
+    tdk can be used to debug how a shell script will behave when called by
+    nefu's shell test.  Stand alone programs that test a service not native
+    to nefu make good candidates for this.  See README.SH.
+
+    tdk can also be used as a platform to build and debug tests that
+    integrate with the nefu's main source.  See README.C.
