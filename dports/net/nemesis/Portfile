description      Nemesis packet injection utility
long_description \
	Nemesis is a command-line network packet injection utility for \
	UNIX-like and Windows systems. You might think of it as an EZ-bake \
	packet oven or a manually controlled IP stack. With Nemesis, it is \
	possible to generate and transmit packets from the command line or \
	from within a shell script.
