long_description	ngrep strives to provide most of GNU grep's common features, applying \

			regular expressions to match against data payloads of packets. It \
			currently recognizes TCP, UDP, and ICMP across Ethernet, PPP, SLIP, \

			logic in the same fashion as more common packet sniffing tools, \
