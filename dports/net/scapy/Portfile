description	      A powerful packet manipulation tool
long_description      \
        Scapy is a powerful interactive packet manipulation program. It is \
        able to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols, send \
        them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies, and much \
        more. It can easily handle most classical tasks like scanning, \
        tracerouting, probing, unit tests, attacks or network discovery (it \
        can replace hping, 85% of nmap, arpspoof, arp-sk, arping, tcpdump, \
        tethereal, p0f, etc.). It also performs very well at a lot of other \
        specific tasks that most other tools can't handle, like sending \
        invalid frames, injecting your own 802.11 frames, combining technics \
        (VLAN hopping+ARP cache poisoning, VOIP decoding on WEP encrypted \
        channel, ...), etc.
