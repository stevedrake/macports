description         TCP flow recorder

long_description    tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as \
                    part of TCP connections (flows), and stores the data in a \
                    way that is convenient for protocol analysis or debugging. \
                    A program like tcpdump(4) shows a summary of packets seen \
                    on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data that's \
                    actually being transmitted. In contrast, tcpflow \
                    reconstructs the actual data streams and stores each flow \
                    in a separate file for later analysis. tcpflow understands \
                    TCP sequence numbers and will correctly reconstruct data \
                    streams regardless of retransmissions or out-of-order \
                    delivery.
