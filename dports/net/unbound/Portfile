long_description    Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS \
                    server software product from NLnet Labs, VeriSign Inc.,\
                    Nominet, and Kirei. It is distributed free of charge \
                    in open source form under the BSD license.\
                    Unbound is designed as a set of modular components \
                    that incorporate modern features, such as enhanced \
                    security (DNSSEC) validation, Internet Protocol \
                    Version 6 (IPv6), and a client resolver library API \
                    as an integral part of the architecture.
