description      Nzb downloader and post processor
long_description \
                 hellanzb is an easy to use app designed to retrieve nzb files and fully process them. \
                 The goal being to make getting files from Usenet as hands-free as possible. Once fully \
                 installed, all that's required is moving an nzb file to the queue directory. The rest: \
                 downloading, par-checking, un-raring, etc. is done automatically by hellanzb.
