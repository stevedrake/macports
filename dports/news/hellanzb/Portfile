description      Nzb downloader and post processor
long_description hellanzb is an easy to use app designed to retrieve nzb \
                 files and fully process them. The goal being to make \
                 getting files from Usenet as hands-free as possible. Once \
                 fully installed, all that's required is moving an nzb file \
                 to the queue directory. The rest: downloading, \
                 par-checking, un-raring, etc. is done automatically by \
                 hellanzb.
