description			Base class for implementing various dependency trees
long_description \
	Algorithm::Dependency is a framework for creating simple read-only \
	dependency heirachies, where you have a set of items that rely on \
	other items in the set, and require actions on them as well.\
	Despite the most visible of these being software installation systems \
	like the CPAN installer, or debian apt-get, they are usefull in other \
	situations. This module intentionally uses implementation-neutral \
	words, to avoid confusion.
