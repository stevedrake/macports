description			Cache::Cache, the Cache interface
long_description \
	The Cache modules are designed to assist a developer in persisting data \
	for a specified period of time. Often these modules are used in web \
	applications to store data locally to save repeated and redundant \
	expensive calls to remote machines or databases. People have also been \
	known to use Cache::Cache for its straightforward interface in sharing \
	data between runs of an application or invocations of a CGI-style \
	script or simply as an easy to use abstraction of the filesystem or \
	shared memory.
