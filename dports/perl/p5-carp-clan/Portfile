description        Report errors from perspective of caller of a "clan" of modules 
long_description   This module reports errors from the perspective of the \
                   caller of a "clan" of modules, similar to "Carp.pm" \
                   itself. But instead of giving it a number of levels to \
                   skip on the calling stack, you give it a pattern to \
                   characterize the package names of the "clan" of modules \
                   which shall never be blamed for any error. :-)
