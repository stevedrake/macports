description           Infrastructure plugin for the Catalyst authentication framework.
long_description      The authentication plugin provides generic user \
                      support. It is the basis for both authentication \
                      (checking the user is who they claim to be), and \
                      authorization (allowing the user to do what \
                      the system authorises them to do).
