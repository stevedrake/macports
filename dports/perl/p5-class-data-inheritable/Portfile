description			Inheritable, overridable class data
long_description \
	Class::Data::Inheritable is for creating accessor/mutators to class \
	data. That is, if you want to store something about your class as a \
	whole (instead of about a single object). This data is then inherited \
	by your subclasses and can be overriden.
