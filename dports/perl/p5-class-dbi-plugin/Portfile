description           Abstract base class for Class::DBI plugins
long_description      Class::DBI::Plugin is an abstract base class for \
                      Class::DBI plugins. Its purpose is to make writing \
                      plugins easier. Writers of plugins should be able to \
                      concentrate on the functionality their module \
                      provides, instead of having to deal with the symbol \
                      table hackery involved when writing a plugin module.
