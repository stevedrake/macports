description			Get information about a class and its structure
long_description \
	Class::Inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class. \
	Most or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they \
	aren't always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high \
	level of Perl wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. \
	Class::Inspector attempts to provide an easier, more friendly \
	interface to this information.
