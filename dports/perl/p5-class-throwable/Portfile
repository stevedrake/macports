description         A minimal lightweight exception class
long_description    This module implements a minimal lightweight exception \
                    object. It is meant to be a compromise between more \
                    basic solutions like Carp which can only print \
                    information and cannot handle exception objects, \
                    and more more complex solutions like Exception::Class \
                    which can be used to define complex inline exceptions \
                    and has a number of module dependencies.
