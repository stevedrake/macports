description           A minimal lightweight exception class
long_description      This module implements a minimal lightweight exception \
                      object. It is meant to be a compromise between more \
                      basic solutions like Carp which can only print \
                      information and cannot handle exception objects, \
                      and more more complex solutions like Exception::Class \
                      which can be used to define complex inline exceptions \
                      and has a number of module dependencies.
