description           Generate fast XS accessors without runtime compilation
long_description      Class::XSAccessor implements fast read, write and \
                      read/write accessors in XS. Additionally, it can \
                      provide predicates such as has_foo() for testing \
                      whether the attribute foo is defined in the object.
