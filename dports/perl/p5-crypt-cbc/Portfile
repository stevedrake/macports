description		Encrypt Data with Cipher Block Chaining Mode
long_description	This is Crypt::CBC, a Perl-only implementation of \
				the cryptographic cipher block chaining mode \
				(CBC).  In combination with a block cipher \
				such as Crypt::DES or Crypt::IDEA, you can \
				encrypt and decrypt messages of arbitrarily \
				long length.  The encrypted messages are \
				compatible with the encryption format used \
				by SSLeay.
