description		Encrypt Data with Cipher Block Chaining Mode
long_description	This is Crypt::CBC, a Perl-only implementation of \
					the cryptographic cipher block chaining mode (CBC). \
					In combination with a block cipher such as \
					Crypt::DES or Crypt::IDEA, you can encrypt and \
					decrypt messages of arbitrarily long length.  The \
					encrypted messages are compatible with the \
					encryption format used by SSLeay.
