long_description                Curses is the interface between Perl and your system's \
				curses(3) library. For descriptions on the usage of a \
				given function, variable, or constant, consult your \
				system's documentation, as such information invariably \
				varies (:-) between different curses(3) libraries and \
				operating systems.
