description        Lightweight yet powerful web application framework

long_description \
    Dancer aims to provide the simplest way for writing web applications, \
    and offers the flexibility to scale between a very simple lightweight \
    web service consisting of a few lines of code in a single file, all the \
    way up to a more complex fully-fledged web application with session \
    support, templates for views and layouts, etc.
