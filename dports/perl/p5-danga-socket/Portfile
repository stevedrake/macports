description         Event loop and event-driven async socket base class
long_description    \
    This is an abstract base class for objects backed by a socket which \
    provides the basic framework for event-driven asynchronous IO, \
    designed to be fast.  Danga::Socket is both a base class for objects, \
    and an event loop. \
    Callers subclass Danga::Socket.  Danga::Socket's constructor registers \
    itself with the Danga::Socket event loop, and invokes callbacks on the \
    object for readability, writability, errors, and other conditions.
