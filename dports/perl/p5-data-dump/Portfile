description		Pretty printing of data structures
long_description	This module provides a single function called dump() that takes a list \
				of values as its argument and produces a string as its result. The string \
				contains Perl code that, when evaled, produces a deep copy of the original \
				arguments. The string is formatted for easy reading. If dump() is called in \
				a void context, then the dump is printed on STDERR instead of being returned.
