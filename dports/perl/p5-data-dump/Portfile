description		Pretty printing of data structures
long_description	This module provides a single function called dump() that \
				takes a list of values as its argument and produces a string \
				as its result. The string contains Perl code that, when \
				evaled, produces a deep copy of the original arguments. The \
				string is formatted for easy reading. If dump() is called in \
				a void context, then the dump is printed on STDERR instead of \
				being returned.
