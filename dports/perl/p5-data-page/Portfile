description		help when paging through sets of results
long_description	When searching through large amounts of data, it is \
			often the case that a result set is returned that is \
			larger than we want to display on one page. This \
			results in wanting to page through various pages of \
			data. The maths behind this is unfortunately fiddly, \
			hence this module.
