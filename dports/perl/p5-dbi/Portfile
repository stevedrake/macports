description      Abstract database access module for Perl
long_description \
	The DBI module enables your Perl applications to access multiple \
	database types transparently. You can connect to MySQL, MSSQL, \
	Oracle, Informix, Sybase, ODBC etc. without having to know the \
	different underlying interfaces of each.  The API defined by DBI \
	will work on all these database types and many more.
