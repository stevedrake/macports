description			Add contextual fetches to DBI 
long_description \
	It always struck me odd that DBI didn't take much advantage of Perl's \
	context sensitivity. DBIx::ContextualFetch redefines some of the \
	various fetch methods to fix this oversight. It also adds a few new \
	methods for convenience (though not necessarily efficiency).
