description         Compile and link C code for Perl modules
long_description    This module can build the C portions of Perl modules by \
                    invoking the appropriate compilers and linkers in a \
                    cross-platform manner.  It was motivated by the \
                    Module::Build project, but may be useful for other \
                    purposes as well.  However, it is not intended as a \
                    general cross-platform interface to all your C building \
                    needs.  That would have been a much more ambitious goal!
