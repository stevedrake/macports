description           Locate per-dist and per-module shared files
long_description      The intent of File::ShareDir is to provide a companion \
                      to Class::Inspector and File::HomeDir, modules that \
                      take a process that is well-known by advanced Perl \
                      developers but gets a little tricky, and make it \
                      more available to the larger Perl community.
