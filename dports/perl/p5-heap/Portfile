description			Collection of routines for managing a heap data structure
long_description \
	This is a collection of routines for managing a heap data structure. \
	There are two major components: a heap component, and an element \
	component. \
	A heap package basically keeps a collection of elements and is able to \
	return the smallest one. \
	The heap component interface is defined in Heap(3) and must be supported \
	by all heap packages.  Currently there are three heap components \
	provided: Heap::Fibonacci (the preferred one), Heap::Binomial, \
    and Heap::Binary
