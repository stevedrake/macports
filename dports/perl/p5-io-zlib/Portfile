description			IO::-style interface to Compress::Zlib
long_description \
	This modules provides an IO:: style interface to the Compress::Zlib \
	package. The main advantage is that you can use an IO::Zlib object in \
	much the same way as an IO::File object so you can have common code that \
	doesn't know which sort of file it is using.
