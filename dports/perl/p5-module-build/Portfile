description			Build and install perl modules (MakeMaker replacement)
long_description \
	Module::Build is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl \
	modules. It is meant to be a replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  \
	Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a \
	much more straightforward way than with MakeMaker. It also does not \
	require a make on your system - most of the Module::Build code is \
	pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way. In fact, you don't \
	even need a shell, so even platforms like MacOS (traditional) can use it \
	fairly easily. Its only prerequisites are modules that are included with \
	perl 5.6.0, and it works fine on perl 5.005 if you can install a few \
	additional modules.
