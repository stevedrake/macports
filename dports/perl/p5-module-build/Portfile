description               Build and install perl modules (MakeMaker replacement)
long_description          Module::Build is a system for building, testing, \
                          and installing Perl modules. It is meant to be a \
                          replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker.  Developers \
                          may alter the behavior of the module through \
                          subclassing in a much more straightforward way than \
                          with MakeMaker. It also does not require a make on \
                          your system - most of the Module::Build code is \
                          pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way. \
                          In fact, you don't even need a shell, so even \
                          platforms like Mac OS (traditional) can use it \
                          fairly easily. Its only prerequisites are modules \
                          that are included with perl 5.6.0, and it works \
                          fine on perl 5.005 if you can install a few \
                          additional modules.
