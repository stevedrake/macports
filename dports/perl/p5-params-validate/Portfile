description		Validate method/function parameters
long_description \
	The Params::Validate module allows you to validate method or function \
	call parameters to an arbitrary level of specificity.  At the simplest \
	level, it is capable of validating the required parameters were given \
	and that no unspecified additional parameters were passed in. It is \
	also capable of determining that a parameter is of a specific type, \
	that it is an object of a certain class hierarchy, that it possesses \
	certain methods, or applying validation callbacks to arguments.
