description           Generate Recursive-Descent Parsers
long_description      RecDescent incrementally generates top-down \
                      recursive-descent text parsers from simple yacc-like \
                      grammar specifications. It provides: \
                      * Regular expressions or literal strings as \
                      terminals (tokens), \
                      * Multiple (non-contiguous) productions for any rule, \
                      * Repeated, optional and alternate subrules within \
                      productions, \
                      * Late-bound (run-time dispatched) subrules \
                      * Full access to Perl within actions specified as \
                      part of the grammar, \
                      * Simple automated error reporting during parser \
                      generation and parsing, \
                      * The ability to commit to, uncommit to, or reject \
                      particular productions during a parse, \
                      * Incremental extension of the parsing grammar (even \
                      during a parse), \
                      * Precompilation of parser objects, \
                      * User-definable reduce-reduce conflict resolution \
                      via "scoring" of matching productions. \
                      See the file "RecDescent.pod" for excruciating \
                      detail on all of this.
