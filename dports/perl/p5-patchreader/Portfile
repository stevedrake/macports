description         utilities for reading, transforming, etc. a patch

long_description    PatchReader is a set of utilities for reading in, \
                    transforming, and doing various other things with a \
                    patch.  It basically allows you to create a chain of \
                    readers that can read a patch, remove files from a \
                    patch, add CVS context, fix up the patch root \
                    according to CVS, and output the patch as raw \
                    unified or through a template processor (used in \
                    some places to output a patch as HTML).
