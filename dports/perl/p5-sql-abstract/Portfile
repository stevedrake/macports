description           Generate SQL from Perl data structures
long_description      This module was inspired by the excellent DBIx::Abstract. \
                      However, in using that module I found that what I really \
                      wanted to do was generate SQL, but still retain complete \
                      control over my statement handles and use the DBI \
                      interface. So, I set out to create an abstract SQL \
                      generation module.
