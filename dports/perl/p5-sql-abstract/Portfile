description			Generate SQL from Perl data structures 
long_description \
	This module was inspired by the excellent DBIx::Abstract. However, in \
	using that module I found that what I really wanted to do was generate \
	SQL, but still retain complete control over my statement handles and \
	use the DBI interface. So, I set out to create an abstract SQL \
	generation module.
