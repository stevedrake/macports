description           rewrite strings based on a set of known prefixes
long_description      This rewrites all the given strings using the rules \
                      in %prefix. Its keys are known prefixes for which \
                      its values will be substituted. This is performed \
                      in longest-first order, and only one prefix will \
                      be rewritten.
