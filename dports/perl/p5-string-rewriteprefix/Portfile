description         rewrite strings based on a set of known prefixes
long_description    This rewrites all the given strings using the rules \
                    in %prefix. Its keys are known prefixes for which \
                    its values will be substituted. This is performed \
                    in longest-first order, and only one prefix will \
                    be rewritten.
