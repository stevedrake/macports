description	Subversion activity notification
long_description \
		This class may be used for sending email messages for \
		Subversion repository activity. There are a number of \
		different modes supported, and SVN::Notify is fully \
		subclassable to easily add new functionality. By default, \
		A list of all the files affected by the commit will be \
		assembled and listed in a single message. An additional option \
		allows diffs to be calculated for the changes and either \
		appended to the message or added as an attachment.
