description			Provides basic first-pass API testing for large class trees
long_description \
	For many APIs with large numbers of classes, it can be very useful to \
	be able to do a quick once-over to make sure that classes, methods, \
	and inheritance is correct, before doing more comprehensive testing. \
	This module aims to provide such a capability.
