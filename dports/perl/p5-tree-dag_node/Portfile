description			A (super)class for representing nodes in a tree
long_description \
	This class encapsulates/makes/manipulates objects that represent nodes \
	in a tree structure.  The tree structure is not an object itself, but is \
	emergent from the linkages you create between nodes.  This class \
	provides the methods for making linkages that can be used to build up a \
	tree, while preventing you from ever making any kinds of linkages which \
	are not allowed in a tree (such as having a node be its own mother or \
	ancestor, or having a node have two mothers).
