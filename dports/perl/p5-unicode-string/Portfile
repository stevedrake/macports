description		String of Unicode characters (UCS2/UTF16)
long_description	A Unicode::String object represents a sequence of Unicode \
			characters. The Unicode Standard is a fixed-width, \
			uniform encoding scheme for written characters and text. \
			This encoding treats alphabetic characters, ideographic \
			characters, and symbols identically, which means that \
			they can be used in any mixture and with equal facility. \
			Unicode is modeled on the ASCII character set, but uses a \
			16-bit encoding to support full multilingual text.
