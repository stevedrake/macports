long_description      WWW::Mechanize, or Mech for short, helps you automate \
                      interaction with a website. It supports performing a \
                      sequence of page fetches including following links and \
                      submitting forms. Each fetched page is parsed and its \
                      links and forms are extracted. A link or a form can be \
                      selected, form fields can be filled and the next page \
                      can be fetched. Mech also stores a history of the URLs \
                      you've visited, which can be queried and revisited.
