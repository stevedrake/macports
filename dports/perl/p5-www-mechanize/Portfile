long_description \
	WWW::Mechanize, or Mech for short, helps you automate interaction with a \
	website. It supports performing a sequence of page fetches including \
	following links and submitting forms. Each fetched page is parsed and \
	its links and forms are extracted. A link or a form can be selected, \
	form fields can be filled and the next page can be fetched. Mech also \
	stores a history of the URLs you've visited, which can be queried and \
	revisited.
