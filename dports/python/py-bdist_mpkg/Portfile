description			Builds Mac OS X installer packages from distutils
long_description \
	bdist_mpkg is a distutils plugin that implements the bdist_mpkg \
	command, which builds a Mac OS X metapackage for use by Installer.app \
	for easy GUI installation of Python modules, much like bdist_wininst. \
	It also comes with a bdist_mpkg script, which is a setup.py front-end \
	that will allow you to easy build an installer metapackage from nearly \
	any existing package that uses distutils.
