description		Python crash handler that handles uncaught exceptions
long_description	PyCrash is a crash handler that handles uncaught \
				exceptions during program execution and collects \
				information about the program context. PyCrash can be \
				very useful in report bug information, because the \
				programmer can easily analyse the program execution \
				context of the crashed application. PyCrash needs \
				threads.
