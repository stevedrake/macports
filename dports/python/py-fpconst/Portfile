description		IEEE 754 floating point special handling for Python
long_description	This python module implements constants and functions \
				for working with IEEE754 double-precision \
				special values. It provides constants for \
				Not-a-Number (NaN), Positive Infinity (Inf), \
				and Negative Infinity (-Inf), as well as \
				functions to test for these values.

# The author of fpconst had his site go down and he replaced the
# tarball with a different file of the same name.  Doing a diff
# between the two shows only minor differences in comments and a
# missing file, but I'm listing here mirrors that contain the file
# with the original hash, to prevent different distributions having
# different hashes.  It seems better to have consistent hashes than be
# consistent with the new file.
