description			Model-View-Controller for PyGTK2
long_description \
	This is an implementation of the Model-View-Controller and Observer \
	patterns for the Pygtk2 toolkit.  MVC is a pattern that can be \
	successfully used to design and develop well structured GUI applications. \
	The MVC pattern basically helps in separating sematics and data of the \
	application, from their representation. The Observer pattern is also \
	embedded here. This pattern allows making separated parts independent, \
	but still connected each other.
