description      The iCalendar package is a parser/generator of RFC 2445 iCalendar files.
long_description The inspiration has come from the email package in the standard lib, which I think is pretty simple, yet efficient and \
                 powerful. The package can both generate and parse iCalendar files, and can easily be used as is. \
                 The aim is to make a package that is fully compliant to RFC 2445, well designed, simple to use and well documented.
