long_description \
	The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of python source code \
	for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse, pylint... Well, actually the development of \
	this library is essentialy governed by pylint's needs. \
	\
	It extends class defined in the compiler.ast module with some additional methods and \
	attributes. Instance attributes are added by a builder object, which can either generate \
	extended ast (let's call them astng) by visiting an existant ast tree or by inspecting \
	living object. Methods are added by monkey patching ast classes.
