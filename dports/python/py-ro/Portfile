description		advanced Distributed Object Technology for python
long_description	Pyro is an acronym for PYthon Remote Objects. It is \
				an advanced and powerful Distributed Object Technology system \
				written entirely in Python, that is designed to be very easy \
				to use. It resembles Java's Remote Method Invocation (RMI). It \
				is less similar to CORBA - which is a system- and language \
				independent Distributed Object Technology and has much more to \
				offer than Pyro or RMI. But Pyro is small, simple and free \
				(MIT software license).
