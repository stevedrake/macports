description		object-relational mapper for python
long_description	SQLObject is an object-relational mapper. It allows \
				you to translate RDBMS table rows into Python objects, \
				and manipulate those objects to transparently \
				manipulate the database. In using SQLObject, you will \
				create a class definition that will describe how the \
				object connects to the database (in addition to any \
				other methods you may wish to add to the class). \
				SQLObject will produce the code to access the \
				database, and update the database with your changes. \
				The interface to the database is meant to be \
				indistinguishable from other interfaces you may add to \
				the object. SQLObject also includes a novel feature to \
				generate WHERE clauses using Python syntax and objects \
				(instead of generating SQL using string substitution, \
				as is traditional).
