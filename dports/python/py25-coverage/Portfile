description         Code coverage tool for Python
long_description    Coverage.py is a Python module that measures code \
                    coverage during Python execution. It uses the code \
                    analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python \
                    standard library to determine which lines are \
                    executable, and which have been executed. The original \
                    version was written by Gareth Rees. I've updated it to \
                    determine executable statements more accurately.
