description         The Swiss Army knife of Python web development
long_description    Werkzeug started as simple collection of various \
    utilities for WSGI applications and has become one of the most advanced \
    WSGI utility modules. It includes a powerful debugger, full featured \
    request and response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, \
    cache control headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a \
    powerful URL routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon \
    modules.\
    \
    Werkzeug is unicode aware and doesn't enforce a specific template engine, \
    database adapter or anything else. It doesn't even enforce a specific way \
    of handling requests and leaves all that up to the developer. It's most \
    useful for end user applications which should work on as many server \
    environments as possible (such as blogs, wikis, bulletin boards, etc.).
