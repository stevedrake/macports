description             Lightweight in-process concurrent programming
long_description        The \"greenlet\" package is a spin-off of \
                        Stackless, a version of CPython that supports \
                        micro-threads called \"tasklets\". Tasklets run \
                        pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or \
                        a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized \
                        with data exchanges on \"channels\". \
                        \
                        A \"greenlet\", on the other hand, is a still \
                        more primitive notion of micro-thread with no \
                        implicit scheduling\; coroutines, in other \
                        words. This is useful when you want to control \
                        exactly when your code runs. You can build \
                        custom scheduled micro-threads on top of \
                        greenlet\; however, it seems that greenlets are \
                        useful on their own as a way to make advanced \
                        control flow structures. For example, we can \
                        recreate generators\; the difference with \
                        Python's own generators is that our generators \
                        can call nested functions and the nested \
                        functions can yield values too. Additionally, \
                        you don't need a \"yield\" keyword. See the \
                        example in test_generator.py. \
                        \
                        Greenlets are provided as a C extension module \
                        for the regular unmodified interpreter.
