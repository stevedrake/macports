description     MPI for Python - Python bindings for MPI
long_description \
    MPI for Python (mpi4py) provides bindings of the Message Passing Interface \
    (MPI) standard for the Python programming language, allowing any Python \
    program to exploit multiple processors. This package is constructed on top of \
    the MPI-1/MPI-2 specification and provides an object oriented interface which \
    closely follows MPI-2 C++ bindings. It supports point-to-point (sends, \
    receives) and collective (broadcasts, scatters, gathers) communications of \
    any picklable Python object as well as optimized communications of Python \
    object exposing the single-segment buffer interface (NumPy arrays, builtin \
    bytes/string/array objects).
