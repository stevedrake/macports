description         Easy build, distribution and deployment scripting
long_description    Paver is a Python-based build/distribution/deployment \
    scripting tool along the lines of Make or Rake. What makes Paver unique \
    is its integration with commonly used Python libraries. Common tasks that \
    were easy before remain easy. More importantly, dealing with your \
    applications specific needs and requirements is also easy.
