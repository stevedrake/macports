Frequently Asked Questions
It stopped working, the tool always times out! Is my datalogger broken?

This happens from time to time, especially if you're confusing the PL2303 driver by trying to talk to the logger while it's plugged in but turned off, or by unplugging it during communication.

The problem can usually be fixed by just turning the logger off, unplugging it, stopping any running rgm3800.py scripts and then starting over again.

In rare cases this isn't sufficient, you will then need to unplug the logger and remove batteries for a short while.

Does the RGM-3800 work with GPSd?

Yes, please see this page.

Does the RGM-3800 work with GPSBabel "realtime tracking" (`-T` flag)?

No - at least I couldn't get it to work yet. From looking at the sourcecode it seems like the initial synchronisation is going wrong because the USB-to-serial stuff behaves differently than a "real" serial connection.

Does the RGM-3800 work with Google Earth Realtime GPS tracking?

No. Google Earth uses GPSBabel, please see previous question for more details.
