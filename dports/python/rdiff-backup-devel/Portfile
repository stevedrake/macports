description       backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network
long_description  rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, \
                  possibly over a network. The target directory ends \
                  up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse \
                  diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that \
                  target directory, so you can still recover files \
                  lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best \
                  features of a mirror and an incremental backup. \
                  rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard \
                  links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership, \
                  and modification times. Also, rdiff-backup can \
                  operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, \
                  like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to \
                  securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, \
                  and only the differences will be transmitted. \
                  Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings \
                  have sensical defaults.
