description     backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network
long_description    rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, \
                    possibly over a network. The target directory ends \
                    up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse \
                    diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that \
                    target directory, so you can still recover files \
                    lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best \
                    features of a mirror and an incremental backup. \
                    rdiff-backup also preserves subdirectories, hard \
                    links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership, \
                    and modification times. Also, rdiff-backup can \
                    operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, \
                    like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to \
                    securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, \
                    and only the differences will be transmitted. \
                    Finally, rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings \
                    have sensical defaults.
