description		        Object oriented inteface to Ruby/LDAP
long_description	    Ruby/ActiveLDAP provides an object oriented interface to LDAP. \
                        This library was inspired by ActiveRecord (both the concept and the \
                        library). It maps LDAP entries to Ruby objects with LDAP attribute \
                        accessors exposed as methods dynamically assigned based on your LDAP \
                        schema and each object's objectClasses.
