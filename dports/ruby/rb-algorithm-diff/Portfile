description		diff algorithm for arrays in Ruby
long_description	The diff algorithm computes the differences between \
					two arrays of elements, like the unix program \
					\"diff\". It can diff Arrays by each element or \
					Strings by each character, or your own class if you \
					implement the interface. The algorithm is complete, \
					stable (TestUnit test available), but the interface \
					may change before a 1.0 release.
