description		MIME::Types for Ruby
long_description	This is MIME::Types for Ruby, based on the Perl \
					package of the same name. It is generally kept in \
					sync with the Perl version of MIME::Types.  This \
					package works on the same concept as mailcap, which \
					uses extensions to determine the file's likely MIME \
					content type. This package does not analyse files \
					for magic bytes to determine the appropriate MIME \
					content type.
