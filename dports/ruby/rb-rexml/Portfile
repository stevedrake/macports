description		XML processor for the language Ruby
long_description	REXML is an XML 1.0 compliant, reasonably fast, \
					non-validating XML parser that supports multiple \
					encodings. It has an API that is designed to be \
					intuitive, straightforward, and terse. REXML \
					includes a tree model parser, a SAX2 streaming \
					parser, and a pull parser. It also includes a full \
					XPath implementation. All of REXML's parsers pass \
					100% of the Oasis XML non-validating tests.
