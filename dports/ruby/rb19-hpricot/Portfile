description         a swift, liberal HTML parser with a fantastic library
long_description    \
    Hpricot is a fast, flexible HTML parser written in C. It's designed to be \
    very accommodating (like Tanaka Akira's HTree) and to have a very helpful \
    library (like some JavaScript libs -- JQuery, Prototype -- give you.) \
    The XPath and CSS parser, in fact, is based on John Resig's JQuery. \
    \
    Also, Hpricot can be handy for reading broken XML files, since many of \
    the same techniques can be used. If a quote is missing, Hpricot tries to \
    figure it out. If tags overlap, Hpricot works on sorting them out. \
    You know, that sort of thing.
