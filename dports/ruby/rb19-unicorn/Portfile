description         HTTP server for Rack applications designed for Unix
long_description    \
    Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve \
    fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take advantage \
    of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels. Slow clients should only be served \
    by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering both the the request \
    and response in between Unicorn and slow clients.
