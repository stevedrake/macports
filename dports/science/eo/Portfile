description             an evolutionary computation library
long_description        EO is a templates-based, ANSI-C++ compliant \
                        evolutionary computation library. It contains \
                        classes for almost any kind of evolutionary \
                        computation you might come up to - at least for \
                        the ones we could think of. It is component-based, \
                        so that if you don't find the class you need in it, \
                        it is very easy to subclass existing abstract or \
                        concrete classes.
