description      Off-the-Record Plugin for Pidgin
long_description \
	This is a pidgin plugin which implements Off-the-Record (OTR) \
	Messaging. \
	OTR allows you to have private conversations over IM by providing: \
	- Encryption \
	- No one else can read your instant messages. \
	- Authentication \
	  - You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is. \
	- Deniability \
	  - The messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are \
	    checkable by a third party.  Anyone can forge messages after a \
	    conversation to make them look like they came from you.  However, \
	    _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages \
	   he sees are authentic and unmodified. \
	- Perfect forward secrecy \
	- If you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation \
	  is compromised.
