description			SSL tunneling program
long_description	Stunnel is a program that allows you to encrypt arbitrary \
					TCP connections inside SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) available \
					on both Unix and Windows. Stunnel can allow you to secure \
					non-SSL aware daemons and protocols (like POP, IMAP, LDAP, \
					etc) by having Stunnel provide the encryption, requiring no \
					changes to the daemon's code.
