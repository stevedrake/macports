description      anonymizing overlay network for TCP
long_description \
	Tor provides a distributed network of servers \
	(onion routers). Users bounce their TCP streams \
	(web traffic, FTP, SSH, etc.) around the \
	routers. This makes it hard for recipients, \
	observers, and even the onion routers \
	themselves to track the source of the stream.
