description      Enterprise Audit Shell
long_description \
	Enterprise Audit Shell is an audit framework specifically \
	designed to be used with sudo in large, enterprise environments. \
	EAS starts where sudo leaves off, yet takes advantage of what \
	sudo does best: access control.  Because EAS was designed as a \
	framework, it's completely transparent to the end-users and it \
	allows the System Administrator to add personalized extensions \
	and plug-ins.
