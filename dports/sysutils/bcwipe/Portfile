long_description        The BCWipe software is intended to give you a \
                        confidence that your deleted files cannot be \
                        recovered by an intruder. BCWipe repeatedly \
                        overwrites special patterns to the files to be \
                        destroyed. BCWipe for UNIX offers two wiping \
                        schemas: US DoD 5200.28-STD standard and Peter \
                        Gutmann's 35 pass scheme.
