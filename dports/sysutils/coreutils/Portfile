long_description \
    The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell, and text manipulation \
    utilities of the GNU operating system. These are the core utilities which \
    are expected to exist on every operating system. Previously these \
    utilities were offered as three individual sets of GNU utilities, \
    fileutils, shellutils, and textutils. Those three have been combined into \
    a single set of utilities called the coreutils.
