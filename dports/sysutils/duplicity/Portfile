description		Encrypted bandwidth-efficient backup.
long_description	Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted \
			tar-format volumes and uploading them to a remote or \
			local file server. Because duplicity uses librsync, \
			the incremental archives are space efficient and only \
			record the parts of files that have changed since the \
			last backup. Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt \
			and/or sign these archives, they will be safe from \
			spying and/or modification by the server.
