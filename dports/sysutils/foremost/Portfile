long_description Foremost is a console program to recover files based on \
their headers and footers. Foremost can work on image files, such as those \
generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers \
and footers are specified by a configuration file, so you can pick and \
choose which headers you want to look for.
