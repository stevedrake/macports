description	Tail multiple files in one terminal at once
long_description	MultiTail lets you view one or multiple files like the \
	original tail program. The difference is that it creates multiple \
	windows on your console (with ncurses). Merging of 2 or even more \
	logfiles is possible. It can also use colors while displaying the \
	logfiles (through regular expressions), for faster recognition of what \
	is important and what not. It can also filter lines (again with \
	regular expressions). It has interactive menus for editing given \
	regular expressions and deleting and adding windows. One can also have \
	windows with the output of shell scripts and other software. When \
	viewing the output of external software, MultiTail can mimic the \
	functionality of tools like 'watch' and such.
