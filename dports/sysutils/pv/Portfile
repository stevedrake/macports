description	monitor the progress of data through a pipe
long_description 	\
	pv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool for monitoring 	\
	the progress of data through a pipeline. It can be inserted 	\
	into any normal pipeline between two processes to give a 	\
	visual indication of how quickly data is passing through, 	\
	how long it has taken, how near to completion it is, and an 	\
	estimate of how long it will be until completion.
