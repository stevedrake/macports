This file is placed into ${applications_dir}/Qt as a placehold to
ensure that the directory is created and active before any qt4 port
(qt4-mac, qt4-mac-devel, qt4-x11, qt4-x11-devel) is selected.  You can
disable this directory by deactivating the port 'qt4_select' -- though
you don't want to do this if any qt4 port is active.
