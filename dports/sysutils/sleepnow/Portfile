description		command-line tool to put Mac OS X machine to sleep
long_description	SleepNow is a Mac OS X command-line tool which puts \
					the machine to sleep, just as though someone had \
					used the Sleep menu command while sitting in front \
					of the machine. The advantage is that SleepNow can \
					be run while logged in to the machine from anywhere \
					on the net.
