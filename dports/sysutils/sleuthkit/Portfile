long_description The Sleuth Kit (previously known as TASK) is a collection \
	of UNIX-based command line file system and media management forensic \
	analysis tools. The file system tools allow you to examine file systems of \
	a suspect computer in a non-intrusive fashion. Because the tools do not \
	rely on the operating system to process the file systems, deleted and \
	hidden content is shown. \
	The media management tools allow you to examine the layout of disks and \
	other media. The Sleuth Kit supports DOS partitions, BSD partitions (disk \
	labels), Mac partitions, Sun slices (Volume Table of Contents), and GPT \
	disks. With these tools, you can identify where partitions are located and \
	extract them so that they can be analyzed with file system analysis tools.
