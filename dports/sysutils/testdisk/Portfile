long_description    \
        TestDisk was primarily designed to help recover     \
        lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable  \
        again when these symptoms are caused by faulty      \
        software, certain types of viruses or human error   \
        (such as accidentally erasing your Partition Table).    \
        Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.
