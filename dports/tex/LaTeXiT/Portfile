description     Drag-and-drop LaTeX support for Mac applications

long_description \
                LaTeXiT is a small utility that allows you to quickly typeset \
                LaTeX equations, without bothering with file creation, \
                preambles, and so on. The PDF image obtained can then be \
                exported by drag'n drop to any application supporting it. This \
                is very useful to insert equations in presentations made with \
                Keynote or Powerpoint. LaTeXiT also features an application \
                service, so that you can type and transform equations directly \
                in most text editors (Pages, Nisus Writer Express, TextEdit...).
