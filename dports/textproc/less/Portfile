long_description    	Less is a program similar to more, but which allows backward \
			movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does \
			not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with \
			large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi. \
			Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on \
			a variety of terminals. There is even limited support for \
			hardcopy terminals.
