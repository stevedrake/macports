description		converts between UTF-8 Unicode and 7-bit ASCII equivalents
long_description	uni2ascii and ascii2uni convert between UTF-8 Unicode and \
			more than a dozen 7-bit ASCII equivalents including: hexadecimal \
			and decimal HTML numeric character references, \u-escapes, \
			standard hexadecimal, raw hexadecimal, and RFC2396 URI format. \
			Such ASCII equivalents are encountered in a variety of \
			circumstances, such as when Unicode text is included in program \
			source, when entering text into Web programs that can handle the \
			Unicode character set but are not 8-bit safe, and when debugging.
