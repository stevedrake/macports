description	Simple but very fast web browser
long_description	\
		Dillo is a web browser project completely written in C.	\
		Dillo is small: source is less than 365 KB, and the	\
		binary is around 265 KB!				\
									\
		Dillo aims to be a multi-platform browser alternative	\
		that's small, stable, developer-friendly, usable, fast,	\
		and extensible.						\
									\
		Dillo is mainly based on GTK+ (GNOME is NOT required!)	\
		Dillo is a free-SW project in the terms of the GNU	\
		general public license.  Current code uses		\
		gzilla-0.2.2's html-parser, and almost			\
		everything else was rewritten from scratch!.		\
									\
		Dillo is very fast!

#user_notes	Remember to set the DISPLAY environment variable	\
#		to localhost:0.0 if you start dillo from a non-X11	\
#		terminal application.
