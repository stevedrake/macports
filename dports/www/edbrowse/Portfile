long_description    Edbrowse is a combination editor, browser, and mail client \
                    that is 100% text based.  The interface is similar to \
                    /bin/ed, though there are many more features, such as \
                    editing multiple files simultaneously, and rendering html.\
                    This program was originally written for blind users, but \
                    many sighted users have taken advantage of the unique \
                    scripting capabilities of this program, which can be found \
                    nowhere else.  A batch job, or cron job, can access web \
                    pages on the internet, submit forms, and send email, with \
                    no human intervention whatsoever.  edbrowse can also tap \
                    into databases through odbc.
