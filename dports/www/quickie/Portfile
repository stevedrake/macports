description             A small, fast wiki engine written in C++
long_description        In the words of the author: \
                        "Quickie is a small footprint, fast C++ Wiki engine. I \
                        went looking for small fast wiki engines and didn't \
                        find one.  Too many were written in interpretive \
                        languages with huge run-time footprints.  Quickie is \
                        small and fast."
