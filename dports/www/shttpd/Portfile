long_description \
	SHTTPD is simple, easy to use, embeddable web server with CGI, \
	SSL, cookies support. It is written in C, as one single source \
	file shttpd.c. It compiles both in UNIX and Windows environments. \
	It gives very small footprint when linked against uclibc or \
	dietlibc. It is a good choice to serve Web based GUI for various \
	applications, where other sophisticated servers like Apache, IIS \
	etc are too big, hard to install and configure or overcomplicated. \
	It is good for implementing a web interface for daemons. Ideal for \
	web-oriented software demos. Beginner (and not just beginner) web \
	developers may find it very useful as well: shttpd serves PHP, \
	Perl and other CGI applications without any additional \
	configuration. Regardless its small size, shttpd is fully \
	functional and is ready to be used in production environment.
