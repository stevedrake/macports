long_description \
    Siege is an http regression testing and benchmarking utility. \
    It was designed to let web developers measure the performance \
    of their code under duress, to see how it will stand up to \
    load on the internet. It lets the user hit a web server with \
    a configurable number of concurrent simulated users.
