description		A webmail system which accesses mail over IMAP
long_description	SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP4. It \
			includes built-in pure PHP support for the IMAP and SMTP protocols, and \
			all pages render in pure HTML 4.0 (with no JavaScript) for maximum \
			compatibility across browsers. It has very few requirements and is very \
			easy to configure and install. SquirrelMail has all the functionality \
			you would want from an email client, including strong MIME support, \
			address books, and folder manipulation.
