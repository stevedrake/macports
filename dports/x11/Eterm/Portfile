version		0.9.2
description	Eterm is a color terminal emulator.
long_description	Eterm is a color vt102 terminal emulator intended as a \
			replacement for xterm. It is designed  with a Freedom of \
			Choice philosophy, leaving as much power, flexibility, and \
			freedom as possible in the  hands of the user. It is designed \
			to look good and work well, but takes a feature-rich approach \
			rather than  one of minimalism while still maintaining speed \
			and efficiency.
