long_description  \
    awesome is a tiling window manager initially based on a dwm code\
    rewriting. It is extremely fast, small, dynamic and awesome.\
    Windows can be managed in several layouts: tiled, maximized and floating.\
    Each layout can be applied on the fly, optimizing the environment for the\
    application in use and the task performed.\
    awesome has the following features: very stable, no mouse needed,\
    multihead support, some real transparency support, some xrandr support, no\
    lua integration, no 9P support, no editable tagbars, no limits on its\
    source size, key, script and mouse bindings, etc.
