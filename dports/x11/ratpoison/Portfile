description	Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager.
long_description	Ratpoison is a simple Window Manager with \
					no fat library dependencies, no fancy graphics, \
					no window decorations, and no rodent dependence. \
					It is largely modelled after GNU Screen which \
					has done wonders in the virtual terminal market. \
					The screen can be split into non-overlapping frames. \
					All windows are kept maximized inside their frames \
					to take full advantage of your precious screen \
					real estate. All interaction with the window manager \
					is done through keystrokes. ratpoison has a prefix \
					map to minimize the key clobbering that cripples \
					Emacs and other quality pieces of software.
