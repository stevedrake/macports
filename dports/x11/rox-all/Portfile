long_description \
ROX-All is a single archive containing launchers for most of the ROX applications. \
It contains everything you need to get started with ROX. Because actually putting \
all the software in this archive would make it very big and quickly out of date, \
it will download the latest versions of programs when you run them the first time. \
Therefore, you will need a network connection (but only when downloading or upgrading programs).
