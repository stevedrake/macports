description     GUI toolkit based on Xlib
long_description XForms is a GUI toolkit based on Xlib for X Window Systems. \
                It features a rich set of objects, such as buttons, \
                scrollbars, and menus etc. integrated into an easy and \
                efficient object/event callback execution model that allows \
                fast and easy construction of X-applications. In addition, \
                the library is extensible and new objects can easily be \
                created and added to the library.
