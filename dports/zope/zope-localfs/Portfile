long_description	The Local File System is an add-in product for \
					the Zope web application server. It allows users \
					to access the contents of the file system on a \
					Zope server as if they were contained in the \
					Zope Object Database. It allows you to serve \
					files and browse directories from the local file \
					system (or network shares on Windows platforms). \
					It also allows you to upload files to the file \
					system.
