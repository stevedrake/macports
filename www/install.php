    <h2 class="hdr">Installing MacPorts</h2>

    <p>MacPorts version <?php print $mp_version_major; ?> is available in various formats for download and installation:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;dmg&rdquo; disk images for <a href="<?php print $leopard_dmg; ?>">Leopard (Universal)</a>, <a
        href="<?php print $tiger_dmg; ?>">Tiger (Universal)</a> and <a href="<?php print $panther_dmg; ?>">Panther (PowerPC)
        </a>, containing pkg installers for use with the Mac OS X Installer. By far the simplest intallation procedure
        that most users should <a href="#pkg">follow</a> after meeting the requirements listed <a href="#requirements">
        below</a>.</li>
        <li>In <a href="#source">source form</a> as either a <a href="<?php print $bz2_tarball ?>">tar.bz2</a> package
        or a <a href="<?php print $gz_tarball; ?>">tar.gz</a> one for manual compilation, if you intend to customize your
        installation in any way.</li>
        <li><a href="#svn">SVN checkout</a> of the unpackaged sources, if you wish to follow MacPorts development.</li>
        <li>The <a href="#selfupdate">selfupdate</a> target of the <kbd>port(1)</kbd> command, for users who already have
        MacPorts installed and wish to upgrade to a new release.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Checksums for all our <a href="<?php print $downloads; ?>">downloads</a> are contained in the <a href="<?php print
    $checksums; ?>">checksums file</a>.</p>


    <div id="requirements">

        <p>Please note that in order to install and run MacPorts on Mac OS X, your system must have installations of the
        following components:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Apple's Developer Tools, found at the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/"> Apple Developer
            site</a> or on your Mac OS X installation CDs/DVD.</li>
            <li>The X11 windowing environment (A.K.A. &ldquo;X11 User&rdquo;) and its related SDK package (&ldquo;X11SDK&rdquo;)
            for ports that depend on the functioanlity they provide to compile and run.
                <ul>
                    <li>the &ldquo;X11 User&rdquo; package is an optional installation on your system CDs/DVD for Panther
                    and Tiger, enabled through the &ldquo;Customize&rdquo; button of the installer, whereas it is included
                    by default on Leopard.</li>
                    <li>the &ldquo;X11 SDK&rdquo; package from the Developer Tools will be automatically installed if &ldquo;X11
                    User&rdquo; is already installed, so be sure to install that first.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

    </div>


    <h3 class="subhdr" id="pkg">Mac OS X Package (.pkg) Installer</h3>

    <p>The easiest way to install MacPorts on a Mac OS X system is by downloading the dmg for <a href="<?php print $leopard_dmg; ?>">
    Leopard (Universal)</a>, <a href="<?php print $tiger_dmg; ?>">Tiger (Universal)</a> or <a href="<?php print $panther_dmg; ?>">
    Panther (PowerPC)</a>, respectively, and running the system's Installer by double clicking on the pkg contained therein,
    following the on-screen instructions until completion.</p>

    <p>This procedure will place a fully functional and default MacPorts installation on your host system, ready for
    usage. If needed your shell configuration files will be adapted by the installer to include the necessary settings
    to run MacPorts and the programs it installs, but you may need to open a new shell for these changes to take effect.
    </p>

    <p>The MacPorts &ldquo;<kbd>selfupdate</kbd>&rdquo; command will be run for you by the installer to ensure you have
    our latest available release and the latest revisions to the &ldquo;Portfiles&rdquo; that contain the instructions
    employed in the building and installation of ports. After installation is done, it is recommended that you run this
    step manually on a regular basis to to keep your MacPorts system always current:</p>
    
    <pre>sudo port -d selfupdate</pre>

    <p>At this point you should be ready to enjoy MacPorts!</p>

    <p>Type &ldquo;<kbd>man port</kbd>&rdquo; at the command line prompt and/or browse over to our <a href="<?php print
    $guide_url; ?>">Guide</a> to find out more information about using MacPorts. <a href="#help">Help</a> is also available.
    </p>


    <h3 class="subhdr" id="source">Source Installation</h3>

    <p>If on the other hand you decide to install MacPorts from source there are still a couple of things you will need
    to do after downloading the tarball before you can start installing ports, namely compiling and installing MacPorts
    itself:</p>


    <ol>
        <li>&ldquo;<kbd>cd</kbd>&rdquo; into the directory where you downloaded the package and run &ldquo;<kbd>tar xjvf
        <a href="<?php print $bz2_tarball; ?>">MacPorts-<?php print $mp_version_major; ?>.tar.bz2</a></kbd>&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;<kbd>tar xzvf <a href="<?php print $gz_tarball; ?>">MacPorts-<?php print $mp_version_major; ?>.tar.gz</a>
        </kbd>&rdquo;, depending on whether you downloaded the bz2 tarball or the gz one, respectively.</li>
        <li>Build and install the recently unpacked sources:
            <ul>
                <li><kbd>cd MacPorts-<?php print $mp_version_major; ?></kbd></li>
                <li><kbd>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</kbd></li>
            </ul>
            Optionally:
            <ul>
                <li><kbd>cd ../</kbd></li>
                <li><kbd>rm -rf MacPorts-<?php print $mp_version_major; ?>*</kbd></li>
            </ul>
            
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>These steps need to be perfomed from an administrator account, for which &ldquo;<kbd>sudo</kbd>&rdquo; will ask
    the password upon installation. This procedure will install a pristine MacPorts system and, if the optional steps are
    taken, remove the as of now unnecessary MacPorts-<?php print $mp_version_major; ?> source directory and corresponding
    tarball.</p>

    <p>To customize your installation you should read the output of &ldquo;<kbd>./configure --help | more</kbd>&rdquo;
    and pass the appropriate options for the settings you wish to tweak to the configuration script in the steps detailed
    above.</p>
	
    <p>You will need to manually adapt your shell's environment to work with MacPorts and your chosen installation <kbd>
    prefix</kbd> (the value passed to <kbd>configure</kbd>'s <kbd>--prefix</kbd> flag, defaulting to <kbd>/opt/local</kbd>):
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><kbd>Add ${prefix}/bin</kbd> and <kbd>${prefix}/sbin</kbd> to the start of your <kbd>PATH</kbd> environment
        variable so that MacPorts installed programs take precedence over equally named system provided programs.</li>
        <li>Add an appropriate X11 <kbd>DISPLAY</kbd> environment variable to run X11 dependent programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Lastly, you need to synchronize your installation with the MacPorts rsync server:</p>

    <pre>sudo port -d selfupdate</pre>

    <p>Upon completion MacPorts will be ready to install ports! </p>

    <p>It is recommended to run the above command on a regular basis to keep your installation current. Type &ldquo;<kbd>
    man port</kbd>&rdquo; at the command line prompt and/or browse over to our <a href="<?php print $guide_url; ?>">Guide
    </a> to find out more information about using MacPorts. <a href="#help">Help</a> is also available.</p>


    <h3 class="subhdr" id="svn">SVN Sources</h3>

    <p>If you are developer or a user with a taste for the bleeding edge and wish for the latest changes and feature
    additions, you may acquire the MacPorts sources through SVN.</p>

    <p>Use the following command to check the project's &ldquo;trunk&rdquo; out of the MacPorts anonymous subversion
    repository, containing all of our source modules (MacPorts' &ldquo;base&rdquo;, the ports tree and all of
    documentation in raw form):</p>

    <pre>svn co <?php print $svn_url . 'trunk'; ?></pre>

    <p>Purpose specific branches are also available at the <kbd><?php print $svn_url . 'branches'; ?></kbd> url.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, if you'd simply like to view the SVN repository without checking it out, you can do so via the <a
    href="http://trac.macports.org/projects/macports/browser">Trac source browser</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h3 class="subhdr" id="selfupdate">Selfupdate</h3>

    <p>If you already have MacPorts installed and have no restrictions to use the rsync networking protocol (tcp port 873 by
    default), the easiest way to upgrade to our latest available release, <b><?php print $mp_version_latest; ?></b>, is by using
    the <kbd>selfupdate</kbd> target of the <kbd>port(1)</kbd> command. This will both update your ports tree (by performing
    a <kbd>sync</kbd> operation) and rebuild your current installation if it's outdated, preserving your customizations if any.</p>
    

    <h3 class="subhdr">Other Platforms</h3>

    <p>Running on platforms other than Mac OS X is not the main focus of The MacPorts Project, so remaining cross-platform
    is not an actively pursued development goal. Nevertheless, it is not an actively discouraged goal either and as a
    result some experimental support does exist for other POSIX compliant platforms such as *BSD and GNU/Linux.</p>

    <p>The full list of requirements to run MacPorts on these other platforms is as follows (we assume you have the
    basics such as GCC and X11):</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl</a> (8.3 or 8.4), with threads</li>
        <li><a href="http://gnustep.org/">GNUstep</a> (Base), for Foundation</li>
        <li><a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> for syncing the ports</li>
        <li><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">cURL</a> for downloading distfiles</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> or <a href="http://martin.hinner.info/libmd/">libmd</a> for
        checksums</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Normally you must install from <a href="#source">source</a> or from an <a href="#svn">SVN checkout</a> to run
    MacPorts on any of these platforms.</p>
